<h3>  BOOK I.</h3>
<p class="pfirst">
<span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>f Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit<br/>
Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast<br/>
Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,<br/>
With loss of <i>Eden</i>, till one greater Man<br/>
Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,<br/>
Sing Heav’nly Muse, that on the secret top<br/>
Of <i>Oreb</i>, or of <i>Sinai</i>, didst inspire<br/>
That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,<br/>
In the Beginning how the Heav’ns and Earth<br/>
Rose out of <i>Chaos</i>: Or if <i>Sion</i> Hill<br/>
Delight thee more, and <i>Siloa’s</i> Brook that flow’d<br/>
Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence<br/>
Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,<br/>
That with no middle flight intends to soar<br/>
Above th’ <i>Aonian</i> Mount, while it pursues<br/>
Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.<br/>
And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer<br/>
Before all Temples th’ upright heart and pure,<br/>
Instruct me, for Thou know’st; Thou from the first<br/>
Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread<br/>
Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss<br/>
And mad’st it pregnant: What in me is dark<br/>
Illumine, what is low raise and support;<br/>
That to the highth of this great Argument<br/>
I may assert th’ Eternal Providence,<br/>
And justifie the wayes of God to men.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Say first, for Heav’n hides nothing from thy view<br/>
Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause<br/>
Mov’d our Grand Parents in that happy State,<br/>
Favour’d of Heav’n so highly, to fall off<br/>
From their Creator, and transgress his Will<br/>
For one restraint, Lords of the World besides?<br/>
Who first seduc’d them to that fowl revolt?<br/>
Th’ infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile<br/>
Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv’d<br/>
The Mother of Mankinde, what time his Pride<br/>
Had cast him out from Heav’n, with all his Host<br/>
Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring<br/>
To set himself in Glory above his Peers,<br/>
He trusted to have equal’d the most High,<br/>
If he oppos’d; and with ambitious aim<br/>
Against the Throne and Monarchy of God<br/>
Rais’d impious War in Heav’n and Battel proud<br/>
With vain attempt.  Him the Almighty Power<br/>
Hurld headlong flaming from th’ Ethereal Skie<br/>
With hideous ruine and combustion down<br/>
To bottomless perdition, there to dwell<br/>
In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,<br/>
Who durst defie th’ Omnipotent to Arms.<br/>
Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night<br/>
To mortal men, he with his horrid crew<br/>
Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe<br/>
Confounded though immortal: But his doom<br/>
Reserv’d him to more wrath; for now the thought<br/>
Both of lost happiness and lasting pain<br/>
Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes<br/>
That witness’d huge affliction and dismay<br/>
Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate:<br/>
At once as far as Angels kenn he views<br/>
The dismal Situation waste and wilde,<br/>
A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round<br/>
As one great Furnace flam’d, yet from those flames<br/>
No light, but rather darkness visible<br/>
Serv’d only to discover sights of woe,<br/>
Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace<br/>
And rest can never dwell, hope never comes<br/>
That comes to all; but torture without end<br/>
Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed<br/>
With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum’d:<br/>
Such place Eternal Justice had prepar’d<br/>
For those rebellious, here their Prison ordain’d<br/>
In utter darkness, and their portion set<br/>
As far remov’d from God and light of Heav’n<br/>
As from the Center thrice to th’ utmost Pole.<br/>
O how unlike the place from whence they fell!<br/>
There the companions of his fall, o’rewhelm’d<br/>
With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,<br/>
He soon discerns, and weltring by his side<br/>
One next himself in power, and next in crime,<br/>
Long after known in <i>Palestine</i>, and nam’d<br/>
<i>Beelzebub</i>.  To whom th’ Arch-Enemy,<br/>
And thence in Heav’n call’d Satan, with bold words<br/>
Breaking the horrid silence thus began.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
If thou beest he; But O how fall’n! how chang’d<br/>
From him, who in the happy Realms of Light<br/>
Cloth’d with transcendent brightnes didst outshine<br/>
Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league,<br/>
United thoughts and counsels, equal hope,<br/>
And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,<br/>
Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd<br/>
In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest<br/>
From what highth fal’n, so much the stronger provd<br/>
He with his Thunder: and till then who knew<br/>
The force of those dire Arms? yet not for those<br/>
Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage<br/>
Can else inflict do I repent or change,<br/>
Though chang’d in outward lustre; that fixt mind<br/>
And high disdain, from sence of injur’d merit,<br/>
That with the mightiest rais’d me to contend,<br/>
And to the fierce contention brought along<br/>
Innumerable force of Spirits arm’d<br/>
That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,<br/>
His utmost power with adverse power oppos’d<br/>
In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav’n,<br/>
And shook his throne.  What though the field be lost?<br/>
All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,<br/>
And study of revenge, immortal hate,<br/>
And courage never to submit or yield:<br/>
And what is else not to be overcome?<br/>
That Glory never shall his wrath or might<br/>
Extort from me.  To bow and sue for grace<br/>
With suppliant knee, and deifie his power<br/>
Who from the terrour of this Arm so late<br/>
Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed,<br/>
That were an ignominy and shame beneath<br/>
This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods<br/>
And this Empyreal substance cannot fail,<br/>
Since through experience of this great event<br/>
In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc’t,<br/>
We may with more successful hope resolve<br/>
To wage by force or guile eternal Warr<br/>
Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe,<br/>
Who now triumphs, and in th’ excess of joy<br/>
Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav’n.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake th’ Apostate Angel, though in pain,<br/>
Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:<br/>
And him thus answer’d soon his bold Compeer.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,<br/>
That led th’ imbattelld Seraphim to Warr<br/>
Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds<br/>
Fearless, endanger’d Heav’ns perpetual King;<br/>
And put to proof his high Supremacy,<br/>
Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,<br/>
Too well I see and rue the dire event,<br/>
That with sad overthrow and foul defeat<br/>
Hath lost us Heav’n, and all this mighty Host<br/>
In horrible destruction laid thus low,<br/>
As far as Gods and Heav’nly Essences<br/>
Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains<br/>
Invincible, and vigour soon returns,<br/>
Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state<br/>
Here swallow’d up in endless misery.<br/>
But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now<br/>
Of force believe Almighty, since no less<br/>
Then such could hav orepow’rd such force as ours)<br/>
Have left us this our spirit and strength intire<br/>
Strongly to suffer and support our pains,<br/>
That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,<br/>
Or do him mightier service as his thralls<br/>
By right of Warr, what e’re his business be<br/>
Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,<br/>
Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;<br/>
What can it then avail though yet we feel<br/>
Strength undiminisht, or eternal being<br/>
To undergo eternal punishment?<br/>
Whereto with speedy words th’ Arch-fiend reply’d.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Fall’n Cherube, to be weak is miserable<br/>
Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure,<br/>
To do ought good never will be our task,<br/>
But ever to do ill our sole delight,<br/>
As being the contrary to his high will<br/>
Whom we resist.  If then his Providence<br/>
Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,<br/>
Our labour must be to pervert that end,<br/>
And out of good still to find means of evil;<br/>
Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps<br/>
Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb<br/>
His inmost counsels from their destind aim.<br/>
But see the angry Victor hath recall’d<br/>
His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit<br/>
Back to the Gates of Heav’n: The Sulphurous Hail<br/>
Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid<br/>
The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice<br/>
Of Heav’n receiv’d us falling, and the Thunder,<br/>
Wing’d with red Lightning and impetuous rage,<br/>
Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now<br/>
To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.<br/>
Let us not slip th’ occasion, whether scorn,<br/>
Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.<br/>
Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,<br/>
The seat of desolation, voyd of light,<br/>
Save what the glimmering of these livid flames<br/>
Casts pale and dreadful?  Thither let us tend<br/>
From off the tossing of these fiery waves,<br/>
There rest, if any rest can harbour there,<br/>
And reassembling our afflicted Powers,<br/>
Consult how we may henceforth most offend<br/>
Our Enemy, our own loss how repair,<br/>
How overcome this dire Calamity,<br/>
What reinforcement we may gain from Hope,<br/>
If not what resolution from despare.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate<br/>
With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes<br/>
That sparkling blaz’d, his other Parts besides<br/>
Prone on the Flood, extended long and large<br/>
Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge<br/>
As whom the Fables name of monstrous size,<br/>
<i>Titanian</i>, or <i>Earth-born</i>, that warr’d on <i>Jove</i>,<br/>
<i>Briarios</i> or <i>Typhon</i>, whom the Den<br/>
By ancient <i>Tarsus</i> held, or that Sea-beast<br/>
<i>Leviathan</i>, which God of all his works<br/>
Created hugest that swim th’ Ocean stream:<br/>
Him haply slumbring on the <i>Norway</i> foam<br/>
The Pilot of some small night-founder’d Skiff,<br/>
Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,<br/>
With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind<br/>
Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night<br/>
Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:<br/>
So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay<br/>
Chain’d on the burning Lake, nor ever thence<br/>
Had ris’n or heav’d his head, but that the will<br/>
And high permission of all-ruling Heaven<br/>
Left him at large to his own dark designs,<br/>
That with reiterated crimes he might<br/>
Heap on himself damnation, while he sought<br/>
Evil to others, and enrag’d might see<br/>
How all his malice serv’d but to bring forth<br/>
Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn<br/>
On Man by him seduc’t, but on himself<br/>
Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour’d.<br/>
Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool<br/>
His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames<br/>
Drivn backward slope their pointing spires, &amp; rowld<br/>
In billows, leave i’th’ midst a horrid Vale.<br/>
Then with expanded wings he stears his flight<br/>
Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air<br/>
That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land<br/>
He lights, if it were Land that ever burn’d<br/>
With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;<br/>
And such appear’d in hue, as when the force<br/>
Of subterranean wind transports a Hill<br/>
Torn from <i>Pelorus</i>, or the shatter’d side<br/>
Of thundring <i>Aetna</i>, whose combustible<br/>
And fewel’d entrals thence conceiving Fire,<br/>
Sublim’d with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,<br/>
And leave a singed bottom all involv’d<br/>
With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole<br/>
Of unblest feet.  Him followed his next Mate,<br/>
Both glorying to have scap’t the <i>Stygian</i> flood<br/>
As Gods, and by their own recover’d strength,<br/>
Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,<br/>
Said then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat<br/>
That we must change for Heav’n, this mournful gloom<br/>
For that celestial light?  Be it so, since hee<br/>
Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid<br/>
What shall be right: fardest from him is best<br/>
Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream<br/>
Above his equals.  Farewel happy Fields<br/>
Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail<br/>
Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell<br/>
Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings<br/>
A mind not to be chang’d by Place or Time.<br/>
The mind is its own place, and in it self<br/>
Can make a Heav’n of Hell, a Hell of Heav’n.<br/>
What matter where, if I be still the same,<br/>
And what I should be, all but less then hee<br/>
Whom Thunder hath made greater?  Here at least<br/>
We shall be free; th’ Almighty hath not built<br/>
Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:<br/>
Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce<br/>
To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:<br/>
Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav’n.<br/>
But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,<br/>
Th’ associates and copartners of our loss<br/>
Lye thus astonisht on th’ oblivious Pool,<br/>
And call them not to share with us their part<br/>
In this unhappy Mansion, or once more<br/>
With rallied Arms to try what may be yet<br/>
Regaind in Heav’n, or what more lost in Hell?<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So <i>Satan</i> spake, and him <i>Beelzebub</i><br/>
Thus answer’d.  Leader of those Armies bright,<br/>
Which but th’ Omnipotent none could have foyld,<br/>
If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge<br/>
Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft<br/>
In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge<br/>
Of battel when it rag’d, in all assaults<br/>
Their surest signal, they will soon resume<br/>
New courage and revive, though now they lye<br/>
Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,<br/>
As we erewhile, astounded and amaz’d,<br/>
No wonder, fall’n such a pernicious highth.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
He scarce had ceas’t when the superiour Fiend<br/>
Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield<br/>
Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,<br/>
Behind him cast; the broad circumference<br/>
Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb<br/>
Through Optic Glass the <i>Tuscan</i> Artist views<br/>
At Ev’ning from the top of <i>Fesole</i>,<br/>
Or in <i>Valdarno</i>, to descry new Lands,<br/>
Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.<br/>
His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine<br/>
Hewn on <i>Norwegian</i> hills, to be the Mast<br/>
Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand,<br/>
He walkt with to support uneasie steps<br/>
Over the burning Marle, not like those steps<br/>
On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime<br/>
Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;<br/>
Nathless he so endur’d, till on the Beach<br/>
Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call’d<br/>
His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans’t<br/>
Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks<br/>
In <i>Vallombrosa</i>, where th’ <i>Etrurian</i> shades<br/>
High overarch’t imbowr; or scatterd sedge<br/>
Afloat, when with fierce Winds <i>Orion</i> arm’d<br/>
Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew<br/>
<i>Busiris</i> and his <i>Memphian</i> Chivalrie,<br/>
VVhile with perfidious hatred they pursu’d<br/>
The Sojourners of <i>Goshen</i>, who beheld<br/>
From the safe shore their floating Carkases<br/>
And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown<br/>
Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,<br/>
Under amazement of their hideous change.<br/>
He call’d so loud, that all the hollow Deep<br/>
Of Hell resounded.  Princes, Potentates,<br/>
Warriers, the Flowr of Heav’n, once yours, now lost,<br/>
If such astonishment as this can sieze<br/>
Eternal spirits; or have ye chos’n this place<br/>
After the toyl of Battel to repose<br/>
Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find<br/>
To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav’n?<br/>
Or in this abject posture have ye sworn<br/>
To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds<br/>
Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood<br/>
With scatter’d Arms and Ensigns, till anon<br/>
His swift pursuers from Heav’n Gates discern<br/>
Th’ advantage, and descending tread us down<br/>
Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts<br/>
Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.<br/>
Awake, arise, or be for ever fall’n.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung<br/>
Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch<br/>
On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,<br/>
Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.<br/>
Nor did they not perceave the evil plight<br/>
In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;<br/>
Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd<br/>
Innumerable.  As when the potent Rod<br/>
Of <i>Amrams</i> Son in <i>Egypts</i> evill day<br/>
Wav’d round the Coast, up call’d a pitchy cloud<br/>
Of <i>Locusts</i>, warping on the Eastern Wind,<br/>
That ore the Realm of impious <i>Pharoah</i> hung<br/>
Like Night, and darken’d all the Land of <i>Nile</i>:<br/>
So numberless were those bad Angels seen<br/>
Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell<br/>
’Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;<br/>
Till, as a signal giv’n, th’ uplifted Spear<br/>
Of their great Sultan waving to direct<br/>
Thir course, in even ballance down they light<br/>
On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;<br/>
A multitude, like which the populous North<br/>
Pour’d never from her frozen loyns, to pass<br/>
<i>Rhene</i> or the <i>Danaw</i>, when her barbarous Sons<br/>
Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread<br/>
Beneath <i>Gibraltar</i> to the <i>Lybian</i> sands.<br/>
Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band<br/>
The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood<br/>
Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms<br/>
Excelling human, Princely Dignities,<br/>
And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;<br/>
Though of their Names in heav’nly Records now<br/>
Be no memorial, blotted out and ras’d<br/>
By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.<br/>
Nor had they yet among the Sons of <i>Eve</i><br/>
Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,<br/>
Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,<br/>
By falsities and lyes the greatest part<br/>
Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake<br/>
God their Creator, and th’ invisible<br/>
Glory of him, that made them, to transform<br/>
Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn’d<br/>
With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,<br/>
And Devils to adore for Deities:<br/>
Then were they known to men by various Names,<br/>
And various Idols through the Heathen World.<br/>
Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last,<br/>
Rous’d from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,<br/>
At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth<br/>
Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,<br/>
While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof?<br/>
The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell<br/>
Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix<br/>
Their Seats long after next the Seat of God,<br/>
Their Altars by his Altar, Gods ador’d<br/>
Among the Nations round, and durst abide<br/>
<i>Jehovah</i> thundring out of <i>Sion</i>, thron’d<br/>
Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac’d<br/>
Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines,<br/>
Abominations; and with cursed things<br/>
His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan’d,<br/>
And with their darkness durst affront his light.<br/>
First <i>Moloch</i>, horrid King besmear’d with blood<br/>
Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,<br/>
Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud<br/>
Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire<br/>
To his grim Idol.  Him the <i>Ammonite</i><br/>
Worshipt in <i>Rabba</i> and her watry Plain,<br/>
In <i>Argob</i> and in <i>Basan</i>, to the stream<br/>
Of utmost <i>Arnon</i>.  Nor content with such<br/>
Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart<br/>
Of <i>Solomon</i> he led by fraud to build<br/>
His Temple right against the Temple of God<br/>
On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove<br/>
The pleasant Vally of <i>Hinnom</i>, <i>Tophet</i> thence<br/>
And black <i>Gehenna</i> call’d, the Type of Hell.<br/>
Next <i>Chemos</i>, th’ obscene dread of <i>Moabs</i> Sons,<br/>
From <i>Aroer</i> to <i>Nebo</i>, and the wild<br/>
Of Southmost <i>Abarim</i>; in <i>Hesebon</i><br/>
And <i>Heronaim</i>, <i>Seons</i> Realm, beyond<br/>
The flowry Dale of <i>Sibma</i> clad with Vines,<br/>
And <i>Eleale</i> to th’ <i>Asphaltick</i> Pool.<br/>
<i>Peor</i> his other Name, when he entic’d<br/>
<i>Israel</i> in <i>Sittim</i> on their march from <i>Nile</i><br/>
To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.<br/>
Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg’d<br/>
Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove<br/>
Of <i>Moloch</i> homicide, lust hard by hate;<br/>
Till good <i>Josiah</i> drove them thence to Hell.<br/>
With these came they, who from the bordring flood<br/>
Of old <i>Euphrates</i> to the Brook that parts<br/>
<i>Egypt</i> from <i>Syrian</i> ground, had general Names<br/>
Of <i>Baalim</i> and <i>Ashtaroth</i>, those male,<br/>
These Feminine.  For Spirits when they please<br/>
Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft<br/>
And uncompounded is their Essence pure,<br/>
Not ti’d or manacl’d with joynt or limb,<br/>
Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,<br/>
Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose<br/>
Dilated or condens’t, bright or obscure,<br/>
Can execute their aerie purposes,<br/>
And works of love or enmity fulfill.<br/>
For those the Race of <i>Israel</i> oft forsook<br/>
Their living strength, and unfrequented left<br/>
His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down<br/>
To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low<br/>
Bow’d down in Battel, sunk before the Spear<br/>
Of despicable foes.  With these in troop<br/>
Came <i>Astoreth</i>, whom the <i>Phoenicians</i> call’d<br/>
<i>Astarte</i>, Queen of Heav’n, with crescent Horns;<br/>
To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon<br/>
<i>Sidonian</i> Virgins paid their Vows and Songs,<br/>
In <i>Sion</i> also not unsung, where stood<br/>
Her Temple on th’ offensive Mountain, built<br/>
By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,<br/>
Beguil’d by fair Idolatresses, fell<br/>
To Idols foul. <i>Thammuz</i> came next behind,<br/>
Whose annual wound in <i>Lebanon</i> allur’d<br/>
The <i>Syrian</i> Damsels to lament his fate<br/>
In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,<br/>
While smooth <i>Adonis</i> from his native Rock<br/>
Ran purple to the Sea, suppos’d with blood<br/>
Of <i>Thammuz</i> yearly wounded: the Love-tale<br/>
Infected <i>Sions</i> daughters with like heat,<br/>
Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch<br/>
<i>Ezekiel</i> saw, when by the Vision led<br/>
His eye survay’d the dark Idolatries<br/>
Of alienated <i>Judah</i>.  Next came one<br/>
Who mourn’d in earnest, when the Captive Ark<br/>
Maim’d his brute Image, head and hands lopt off<br/>
In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,<br/>
Where he fell flat, and sham’d his Worshipers:<br/>
<i>Dagon</i> his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man<br/>
And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high<br/>
Rear’d in <i>Azotus</i>, dreaded through the Coast<br/>
Of <i>Palestine</i>, in <i>Gath</i> and <i>Ascalon</i>,<br/>
And <i>Accaron</i> and <i>Gaza’s</i> frontier bounds.<br/>
Him follow’d <i>Rimmon</i>, whose delightful Seat<br/>
Was fair <i>Damscus</i>, on the fertil Banks<br/>
Of <i>Abbana</i> and <i>Pharphar</i>, lucid streams.<br/>
He also against the house of God was bold:<br/>
A Leper once he lost and gain’d a King,<br/>
<i>Ahaz</i> his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew<br/>
Gods Altar to disparage and displace<br/>
For one of <i>Syrian</i> mode, whereon to burn<br/>
His odious offrings, and adore the Gods<br/>
Whom he had vanquisht. After these appear’d<br/>
A crew who under Names of old Renown,<br/>
<i>Osiris</i>, <i>Isis</i>, <i>Orus</i> and their Train<br/>
With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus’d<br/>
Fanatic <i>Egypt</i> and her Priests, to seek<br/>
Thir wandring Gods disguis’d in brutish forms<br/>
Rather then human.  Nor did <i>Israel</i> scape<br/>
Th’ infection when their borrow’d Gold compos’d<br/>
The Calf in <i>Oreb</i>: and the Rebel King<br/>
Doubl’d that sin in <i>Bethel</i> and in <i>Dan</i>,<br/>
Lik’ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,<br/>
<i>Jehovah</i>, who in one Night when he pass’d<br/>
From <i>Egypt</i> marching, equal’d with one stroke<br/>
Both her first born and all her bleating Gods.<br/>
<i>Belial</i> came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd<br/>
Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love<br/>
Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood<br/>
Or Altar smoak’d; yet who more oft then hee<br/>
In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest<br/>
Turns Atheist, as did <i>Ely’s</i> Sons, who fill’d<br/>
With lust and violence the house of God.<br/>
In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns<br/>
And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse<br/>
Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,<br/>
And injury and outrage: And when Night<br/>
Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons<br/>
Of <i>Belial</i>, flown with insolence and wine.<br/>
Witness the Streets of <i>Sodom</i>, and that night<br/>
In <i>Gibeah</i>, when hospitable Dores<br/>
Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.<br/>
These were the prime in order and in might;<br/>
The rest were long to tell, though far renown’d,<br/>
Th’ <i>Ionian</i> Gods, of <i>Javans</i> Issue held<br/>
Gods, yet confest later then Heav’n and Earth<br/>
Thir boasted Parents; <i>Titian</i> Heav’ns first born<br/>
With his enormous brood, and birthright seis’d<br/>
By younger <i>Saturn</i>, he from mightier <i>Jove</i><br/>
His own and <i>Rhea’s</i> Son like measure found;<br/>
So <i>Jove</i> usurping reign’d: these first in <i>Creet</i><br/>
And <i>Ida</i> known, thence on the Snowy top<br/>
Of cold <i>Olympus</i> rul’d the middle Air<br/>
Thir highest Heav’n; or on the <i>Delphian</i> Cliff,<br/>
Or in <i>Dodona</i>, and through all the bounds<br/>
Of <i>Doric</i> Land; or who with <i>Saturn</i> old<br/>
Fled over <i>Adria</i> to th’ <i>Hesperian</i> Fields,<br/>
And ore the <i>Celtic</i> roam’d the utmost Isles.<br/>
All these and more came flocking; but with looks<br/>
Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear’d<br/>
Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief<br/>
Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost<br/>
In loss it self; which on his count’nance cast<br/>
Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride<br/>
Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore<br/>
Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais’d<br/>
Their fainted courage, and dispel’d their fears.<br/>
Then strait commands that at the warlike sound<br/>
Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard<br/>
His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim’d<br/>
<i>Azazel</i> as his right, a Cherube tall:<br/>
Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld<br/>
Th’ Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc’t<br/>
Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind<br/>
With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz’d,<br/>
Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while<br/>
Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:<br/>
At which the universal Host upsent<br/>
A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond<br/>
Frighted the Reign of <i>Chaos</i> and old Night.<br/>
All in a moment through the gloom were seen<br/>
Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air<br/>
With Orient Colours waving: with them rose<br/>
A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms<br/>
Appear’d, and serried Shields in thick array<br/>
Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move<br/>
In perfect <i>Phalanx</i> to the Dorian mood<br/>
Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais’d<br/>
To highth of noblest temper Hero’s old<br/>
Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage<br/>
Deliberate valour breath’d, firm and unmov’d<br/>
With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,<br/>
Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage<br/>
With solemn touches, troubl’d thoughts, and chase<br/>
Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain<br/>
From mortal or immortal minds.  Thus they<br/>
Breathing united force with fixed thought<br/>
Mov’d on in silence to soft Pipes that charm’d<br/>
Thir painful steps o’re the burnt soyle; and now<br/>
Advanc’t in view they stand, a horrid Front<br/>
Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise<br/>
Of Warriers old with order’d Spear and Shield,<br/>
Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief<br/>
Had to impose: He through the armed Files<br/>
Darts his experienc’t eye, and soon traverse<br/>
The whole Battalion views, thir order due,<br/>
Thir visages and stature as of Gods,<br/>
Thir number last he summs.  And now his heart<br/>
Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength<br/>
Glories: For never since created man,<br/>
Met such imbodied force, as nam’d with these<br/>
Could merit more then that small infantry<br/>
Warr’d on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood<br/>
Of <i>Phlegra</i> with th’ Heroic Race were joyn’d<br/>
That fought at <i>Theb’s</i> and <i>Ilium</i>, on each side<br/>
Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds<br/>
In Fable or <i>Romance</i> of <i>Uthers</i> Son<br/>
Begirt with <i>British</i> and <i>Armoric</i> Knights;<br/>
And all who since, Baptiz’d or Infidel<br/>
Jousted in <i>Aspramont</i> or <i>Montalban</i>,<br/>
<i>Damasco</i>, or <i>Marocco</i>, or <i>Trebisond</i>,<br/>
Or whom <i>Biserta</i> sent from <i>Afric</i> shore<br/>
When <i>Charlemain</i> with all his Peerage fell<br/>
By <i>Fontarabbia</i>.  Thus far these beyond<br/>
Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ’d<br/>
Thir dread Commander: he above the rest<br/>
In shape and gesture proudly eminent<br/>
Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost<br/>
All her Original brightness, nor appear’d<br/>
Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th’ excess<br/>
Of Glory obscur’d: As when the Sun new ris’n<br/>
Looks through the Horizontal misty Air<br/>
Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon<br/>
In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds<br/>
On half the Nations, and with fear of change<br/>
Perplexes Monarchs.  Dark’n’d so, yet shon<br/>
Above them all th’ Arch Angel: but his face<br/>
Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care<br/>
Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes<br/>
Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride<br/>
Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast<br/>
Signs of remorse and passion to behold<br/>
The fellows of his crime, the followers rather<br/>
(Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn’d<br/>
For ever now to have their lot in pain,<br/>
Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc’t<br/>
Of Heav’n, and from Eternal Splendors flung<br/>
For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,<br/>
Thir Glory witherd.  As when Heavens Fire<br/>
Hath scath’d the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,<br/>
With singed top their stately growth though bare<br/>
Stands on the blasted Heath.  He now prepar’d<br/>
To speak; whereat their doubl’d Ranks they bend<br/>
From Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round<br/>
With all his Peers: attention held them mute.<br/>
Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn,<br/>
Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last<br/>
Words interwove with sighs found out their way.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers<br/>
Matchless, but with th’ Almighty, and that strife<br/>
Was not inglorious, though th’ event was dire,<br/>
As this place testifies, and this dire change<br/>
Hateful to utter: but what power of mind<br/>
Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth<br/>
Of knowledge past or present, could have fear’d,<br/>
How such united force of Gods, how such<br/>
As stood like these, could ever know repulse?<br/>
For who can yet beleeve, though after loss,<br/>
That all these puissant Legions, whose exile<br/>
Hath emptied Heav’n, shall faile to re-ascend<br/>
Self-rais’d, and repossess their native seat.<br/>
For me, be witness all the Host of Heav’n,<br/>
If counsels different, or danger shun’d<br/>
By me, have lost our hopes.  But he who reigns<br/>
Monarch in Heav’n, till then as one secure<br/>
Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,<br/>
Consent or custome, and his Regal State<br/>
Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal’d,<br/>
Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.<br/>
Henceforth his might we know, and know our own<br/>
So as not either to provoke, or dread<br/>
New warr, provok’t; our better part remains<br/>
To work in close design, by fraud or guile<br/>
What force effected not: that he no less<br/>
At length from us may find, who overcomes<br/>
By force, hath overcome but half his foe.<br/>
Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife<br/>
There went a fame in Heav’n that he ere long<br/>
Intended to create, and therein plant<br/>
A generation, whom his choice regard<br/>
Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:<br/>
Thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps<br/>
Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere:<br/>
For this Infernal Pit shall never hold<br/>
Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th’ Abysse<br/>
Long under darkness cover.  But these thoughts<br/>
Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,<br/>
For who can think Submission?  Warr then, Warr<br/>
Open or understood must be resolv’d.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew<br/>
Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs<br/>
Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze<br/>
Far round illumin’d hell: highly they rag’d<br/>
Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm’s<br/>
Clash’d on their sounding shields the din of war,<br/>
Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav’n.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top<br/>
Belch’d fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire<br/>
Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign<br/>
That in his womb was hid metallic Ore,<br/>
The work of Sulphur.  Thither wing’d with speed<br/>
A numerous Brigad hasten’d.  As when bands<br/>
Of Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe arm’d<br/>
Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,<br/>
Or cast a Rampart.  <i>Mammon</i> led them on,<br/>
<i>Mammon</i>, the least erected Spirit that fell<br/>
From heav’n, for ev’n in heav’n his looks &amp; thoughts<br/>
Were always downward bent, admiring more<br/>
The riches of Heav’ns pavement, trod’n Gold,<br/>
Then aught divine or holy else enjoy’d<br/>
In vision beatific: by him first<br/>
Men also, and by his suggestion taught,<br/>
Ransack’d the Center, and with impious hands<br/>
Rifl’d the bowels of thir mother Earth<br/>
For Treasures better hid.  Soon had his crew<br/>
Op’nd into the Hill a spacious wound<br/>
And dig’d out ribs of Gold.  Let none admire<br/>
That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best<br/>
Deserve the pretious bane.  And here let those<br/>
Who boast in mortal things, and wondring tell<br/>
Of <i>Babel</i>, and the works of <i>Memphian</i> Kings,<br/>
Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame,<br/>
And Strength and Art are easily outdone<br/>
By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour<br/>
What in an age they with incessant toyle<br/>
And hands innumerable scarce perform<br/>
Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar’d,<br/>
That underneath had veins of liquid fire<br/>
Sluc’d from the Lake, a second multitude<br/>
With wondrous Art founded the massie Ore,<br/>
Severing each kinde, and scum’d the Bullion dross:<br/>
A third as soon had form’d within the ground<br/>
A various mould, and from the boyling cells<br/>
By strange conveyance fill’d each hollow nook,<br/>
As in an Organ from one blast of wind<br/>
To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.<br/>
Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge<br/>
Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound<br/>
Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet,<br/>
Built like a Temple, where <i>Pilasters</i> round<br/>
Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid<br/>
With Golden Architrave; nor did there want<br/>
Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav’n,<br/>
The Roof was fretted Gold.  Not <i>Babilon</i>,<br/>
Nor great <i>Alcairo</i> such magnificence<br/>
Equal’d in all thir glories, to inshrine<br/>
<i>Belus</i> or <i>Serapis</i> thir Gods, or seat<br/>
Thir Kings, when <i>Aegypt</i> with <i>Assyria</i> strove<br/>
In wealth and luxurie.  Th’ ascending pile<br/>
Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores<br/>
Op’ning thir brazen foulds discover wide<br/>
Within, her ample spaces, o’re the smooth<br/>
And level pavement: from the arched roof<br/>
Pendant by suttle Magic many a row<br/>
Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed<br/>
With Naphtha and <i>Asphaltus</i> yeilded light<br/>
As from a sky.  The hasty multitude<br/>
Admiring enter’d, and the work some praise<br/>
And some the Architect: his hand was known<br/>
In Heav’n by many a Towred structure high,<br/>
Where Scepter’d Angels held thir residence,<br/>
And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King<br/>
Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,<br/>
Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright.<br/>
Nor was his name unheard or unador’d<br/>
In ancient Greece; and in <i>Ausonian</i> land<br/>
Men call’d him <i>Mulciber</i>; and how he fell<br/>
From Heav’n, they fabl’d, thrown by angry <i>Jove</i><br/>
Sheer o’re the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn<br/>
To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,<br/>
A Summers day; and with the setting Sun<br/>
Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,<br/>
On <i>Lemnos</i> th’ <i>Aegaean</i> Ile: thus they relate,<br/>
Erring; for he with this rebellious rout<br/>
Fell long before; nor aught avail’d him now<br/>
To have built in Heav’n high Towrs; nor did he scape<br/>
By all his Engins, but was headlong sent<br/>
With his industrious crew to build in hell.<br/>
Mean while the winged Haralds by command<br/>
Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony<br/>
And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim<br/>
A solemn Councel forthwith to be held<br/>
At <i>Pandaemonium</i>, the high Capital<br/>
Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call’d<br/>
From every and Band squared Regiment<br/>
By place or choice the worthiest; they anon<br/>
With hundreds and with thousands trooping came<br/>
Attended: all access was throng’d, the Gates<br/>
And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall<br/>
(Though like a cover’d field, where Champions bold<br/>
Wont ride in arm’d, and at the Soldans chair<br/>
Defi’d the best of Panim chivalry<br/>
To mortal combat or carreer with Lance)<br/>
Thick swarm’d, both on the ground and in the air,<br/>
Brusht with the hiss of russling wings.  As Bees<br/>
In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,<br/>
Poure forth thir populous youth about the Hive<br/>
In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers<br/>
Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank,<br/>
The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel,<br/>
New rub’d with Baume, expatiate and confer<br/>
Thir State affairs.  So thick the aerie crowd<br/>
Swarm’d and were straitn’d; till the Signal giv’n,<br/>
Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd<br/>
In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons<br/>
Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room<br/>
Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race<br/>
Beyond the <i>Indian</i> Mount, or Faerie Elves,<br/>
Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side<br/>
Or Fountain fome belated Peasant sees,<br/>
Or dreams he sees, while over head the Moon<br/>
Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth<br/>
Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth &amp; dance<br/>
Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear;<br/>
At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.<br/>
Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms<br/>
Reduc’d thir shapes immense, and were at large,<br/>
Though without number still amidst the Hall<br/>
Of that infernal Court.  But far within<br/>
And in thir own dimensions like themselves<br/>
The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim<br/>
In close recess and secret conclave sat<br/>
A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat’s,<br/>
Frequent and full.  After short silence then<br/>
And summons read, the great consult began.<br/>

Showrs on her Kings <i>Barbaric</i> Pearl &amp; Gold,<br/>
Satan exalted sat, by merit rais’d<br/>
To that bad eminence; and from despair<br/>
Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires<br/>
Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue<br/>
Vain Warr with Heav’n, and by success untaught<br/>
His proud imaginations thus displaid.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heav’n,<br/>
For since no deep within her gulf can hold<br/>
Immortal vigor, though opprest and fall’n,<br/>
I give not Heav’n for lost.  From this descent<br/>
Celestial vertues rising, will appear<br/>
More glorious and more dread then from no fall,<br/>
And trust themselves to fear no second fate:<br/>
Mee though just right, and the fixt Laws of Heav’n<br/>
Did first create your Leader, next, free choice,<br/>
With what besides, in Counsel or in Fight,<br/>
Hath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss<br/>
Thus farr at least recover’d, hath much more<br/>
Establisht in a safe unenvied Throne<br/>
Yeilded with full consent.  The happier state<br/>
In Heav’n, which follows dignity, might draw<br/>
Envy from each inferior; but who here<br/>
Will envy whom the highest place exposes<br/>
Formost to stand against the Thunderers aime<br/>
Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share<br/>
Of endless pain? where there is then no good<br/>
For which to strive, no strife can grow up there<br/>
From Faction; for none sure will claim in hell<br/>
Precedence, none, whose portion is so small<br/>
Of present pain, that with ambitious mind<br/>
Will covet more.  With this advantage then<br/>
To union, and firm Faith, and firm accord,<br/>
More then can be in Heav’n, we now return<br/>
To claim our just inheritance of old,<br/>
Surer to prosper then prosperity<br/>
Could have assur’d us; and by what best way,<br/>
Whether of open Warr or covert guile,<br/>
We now debate; who can advise, may speak.<br/>

<p class="poem">
He ceas’d, and next him <i>Moloc</i>, Scepter’d King<br/>
Stood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit<br/>
That fought in Heav’n; now fiercer by despair:<br/>
His trust was with th’ Eternal to be deem’d<br/>
Equal in strength, and rather then be less<br/>
Car’d not to be at all; with that care lost<br/>
Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse<br/>
He reckd not, and these words thereafter spake.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
My sentence is for open Warr: Of Wiles,<br/>
More unexpert, I boast not: them let those<br/>
Contrive who need, or when they need, not now.<br/>
For while they sit contriving, shall the rest,<br/>
Millions that stand in Arms, and longing wait<br/>
The Signal to ascend, sit lingring here<br/>
Heav’ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place<br/>
Accept this dark opprobrious Den of shame,<br/>
The Prison of his Tyranny who Reigns<br/>
By our delay? no, let us rather choose<br/>
Arm’d with Hell flames and fury all at once<br/>
O’re Heav’ns high Towrs to force resistless way,<br/>
Turning our Tortures into horrid Arms<br/>
Against the Torturer; when to meet the noise<br/>
Of his Almighty Engin he shall hear<br/>
Infernal Thunder, and for Lightning see<br/>
Black fire and horror shot with equal rage<br/>
Among his Angels; and his Throne it self<br/>
Mixt with <i>Tartarean</i> Sulphur, and strange fire,<br/>
His own invented Torments.  But perhaps<br/>
The way seems difficult and steep to scale<br/>
With upright wing against a higher foe.<br/>
Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench<br/>
Of that forgetful Lake benumme not still,<br/>
That in our proper motion we ascend<br/>
Up to our native seat: descent and fall<br/>
To us is adverse.  Who but felt of late<br/>
When the fierce Foe hung on our brok’n Rear<br/>
Insulting, and pursu’d us through the Deep,<br/>
With what compulsion and laborious flight<br/>
We sunk thus low?  Th’ ascent is easie then;<br/>
Th’ event is fear’d; should we again provoke<br/>
Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find<br/>
To our destruction: if there be in Hell<br/>
Fear to be worse destroy’d: what can be worse<br/>
Then to dwell here, driv’n out from bliss, condemn’d<br/>
In this abhorred deep to utter woe;<br/>
Where pain of unextinguishable fire<br/>
Must exercise us without hope of end<br/>
The Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge<br/>
Inexorably, and the torturing houre<br/>
Calls us to Penance?  More destroy’d then thus<br/>
We should be quite abolisht and expire.<br/>
What fear we then? what doubt we to incense<br/>
His utmost ire? which to the highth enrag’d,<br/>
Will either quite consume us, and reduce<br/>
To nothing this essential, happier farr<br/>
Then miserable to have eternal being:<br/>
Or if our substance be indeed Divine,<br/>
And cannot cease to be, we are at worst<br/>
On this side nothing; and by proof we feel<br/>
Our power sufficient to disturb his Heav’n,<br/>
And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme,<br/>
Though inaccessible, his fatal Throne:<br/>
Which if not Victory is yet Revenge.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
He ended frowning, and his look denounc’d<br/>
Desperate revenge, and Battel dangerous<br/>
To less then Gods.  On th’ other side up rose<br/>
<i>Belial</i>, in act more graceful and humane;<br/>
A fairer person lost not Heav’n; he seemd<br/>
For dignity compos’d and high exploit:<br/>
But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue<br/>
Dropt Manna, and could make the worse appear<br/>
The better reason, to perplex and dash<br/>
Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low;<br/>
To vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds<br/>
Timorous and slothful: yet he pleas’d the eare,<br/>
And with perswasive accent thus began.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
I should be much for open Warr, O Peers,<br/>
As not behind in hate; if what was urg’d<br/>
Main reason to perswade immediate Warr,<br/>
Did not disswade me most, and seem to cast<br/>
Ominous conjecture on the whole success:<br/>
When he who most excels in fact of Arms,<br/>
In what he counsels and in what excels<br/>
Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair<br/>
And utter dissolution, as the scope<br/>
Of all his aim, after some dire revenge.<br/>
First, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav’n are fill’d<br/>
With Armed watch, that render all access<br/>
Impregnable; oft on the bordering Deep<br/>
Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing<br/>
Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night,<br/>
Scorning surprize.  Or could we break our way<br/>
By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise<br/>
With blackest Insurrection, to confound<br/>
Heav’ns purest Light, yet our great Enemie<br/>
All incorruptible would on his Throne<br/>
Sit unpolluted, and th’ Ethereal mould<br/>
Incapable of stain would soon expel<br/>
Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire<br/>
Victorious.  Thus repuls’d, our final hope<br/>
Is flat despair: we must exasperate<br/>
Th’ Almighty Victor to spend all his rage,<br/>
And that must end us, that must be our cure,<br/>
To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose,<br/>
Though full of pain, this intellectual being,<br/>
Those thoughts that wander through Eternity,<br/>
To perish rather, swallowd up and lost<br/>
In the wide womb of uncreated night,<br/>
Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows,<br/>
Let this be good, whether our angry Foe<br/>
Can give it, or will ever? how he can<br/>
Is doubtful; that he never will is sure.<br/>
Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire,<br/>
Belike through impotence, or unaware,<br/>
To give his Enemies thir wish, and end<br/>
Them in his anger, whom his anger saves<br/>
To punish endless? wherefore cease we then?<br/>
Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed,<br/>
Reserv’d and destin’d to Eternal woe;<br/>
Whatever doing, what can we suffer more,<br/>
What can we suffer worse? is this then worst,<br/>
Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms?<br/>
What when we fled amain, pursu’d and strook<br/>
With Heav’ns afflicting Thunder, and besought<br/>
The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem’d<br/>
A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay<br/>
Chain’d on the burning Lake? that sure was worse.<br/>
What if the breath that kindl’d those grim fires<br/>
Awak’d should blow them into sevenfold rage<br/>
And plunge us in the Flames? or from above<br/>
Should intermitted vengeance Arme again<br/>
His red right hand to plague us? what if all<br/>
Her stores were op’n’d, and this Firmament<br/>
Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire,<br/>
Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall<br/>
One day upon our heads; while we perhaps<br/>
Designing or exhorting glorious Warr,<br/>
Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl’d<br/>
Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey<br/>
Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk<br/>
Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains;<br/>
There to converse with everlasting groans,<br/>
Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd,<br/>
Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse.<br/>
Warr therefore, open or conceal’d, alike<br/>
My voice disswades; for what can force or guile<br/>
With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye<br/>
Views all things at one view? he from heav’ns highth<br/>
All these our motions vain, sees and derides;<br/>
Not more Almighty to resist our might<br/>
Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.<br/>
Shall we then live thus vile, the race of Heav’n<br/>
Thus trampl’d, thus expell’d to suffer here<br/>
Chains &amp; these Torments? better these then worse<br/>
By my advice; since fate inevitable<br/>
Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree,<br/>
The Victors will.  To suffer, as to doe,<br/>
Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust<br/>
That so ordains: this was at first resolv’d,<br/>
If we were wise, against so great a foe<br/>
Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.<br/>
I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold<br/>
And vent’rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear<br/>
What yet they know must follow, to endure<br/>
Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain,<br/>
The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now<br/>
Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear,<br/>
Our Supream Foe in time may much remit<br/>
His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov’d<br/>
Not mind us not offending, satisfi’d<br/>
With what is punish’t; whence these raging fires<br/>
Will slack’n, if his breath stir not thir flames.<br/>
Our purer essence then will overcome<br/>
Thir noxious vapour, or enur’d not feel,<br/>
Or chang’d at length, and to the place conformd<br/>
In temper and in nature, will receive<br/>
Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain;<br/>
This horror will grow milde, this darkness light,<br/>
Besides what hope the never-ending flight<br/>
Of future days may bring, what chance, what change<br/>
Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers<br/>
For happy though but ill, for ill not worst,<br/>
If we procure not to our selves more woe.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thus <i>Belial</i> with words cloath’d in reasons garb<br/>
Counsel’d ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath,<br/>
Not peace: and after him thus <i>Mammon</i> spake.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Either to disinthrone the King of Heav’n<br/>
We warr, if warr be best, or to regain<br/>
Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then<br/>
May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yeild<br/>
To fickle Chance, and <i>Chaos</i> judge the strife:<br/>
The former vain to hope argues as vain<br/>
The latter: for what place can be for us<br/>
Within Heav’ns bound, unless Heav’ns Lord supream<br/>
We overpower?  Suppose he should relent<br/>
And publish Grace to all, on promise made<br/>
Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we<br/>
Stand in his presence humble, and receive<br/>
Strict Laws impos’d, to celebrate his Throne<br/>
With warbl’d Hymns, and to his Godhead sing<br/>
Forc’t Halleluiah’s; while he Lordly sits<br/>
Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes<br/>
Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers,<br/>
Our servile offerings.  This must be our task<br/>
In Heav’n, this our delight; how wearisom<br/>
Eternity so spent in worship paid<br/>
To whom we hate.  Let us not then pursue<br/>
By force impossible, by leave obtain’d<br/>
Unacceptable, though in Heav’n, our state<br/>
Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek<br/>
Our own good from our selves, and from our own<br/>
Live to our selves, though in this vast recess,<br/>
Free, and to none accountable, preferring<br/>
Hard liberty before the easie yoke<br/>
Of servile Pomp.  Our greatness will appear<br/>
Then most conspicuous, when great things of small,<br/>
Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse<br/>
We can create, and in what place so e’re<br/>
Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain<br/>
Through labour and endurance.  This deep world<br/>
Of darkness do we dread?  How oft amidst<br/>
Thick clouds and dark doth Heav’ns all-ruling Sire<br/>
Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur’d,<br/>
And with the Majesty of darkness round<br/>
Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar<br/>
Must’ring thir rage, and Heav’n resembles Hell?<br/>
As he our Darkness, cannot we his Light<br/>
Imitate when we please?  This Desart soile<br/>
Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold;<br/>
Nor want we skill or art, from whence to raise<br/>
Magnificence; and what can Heav’n shew more?<br/>
Our torments also may in length of time<br/>
Become our Elements, these piercing Fires<br/>
As soft as now severe, our temper chang’d<br/>
Into their temper; which must needs remove<br/>
The sensible of pain.  All things invite<br/>
To peaceful Counsels, and the settl’d State<br/>
Of order, how in safety best we may<br/>
Compose our present evils, with regard<br/>
Of what we are and where, dismissing quite<br/>
All thoughts of Warr: ye have what I advise.<br/>

<p class="poem">
He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld<br/>
Th’ Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain<br/>
The sound of blustring winds, which all night long<br/>
Had rous’d the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull<br/>
Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance<br/>
Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay<br/>
After the Tempest: Such applause was heard<br/>
As <i>Mammon</i> ended, and his Sentence pleas’d,<br/>
Advising peace: for such another Field<br/>
They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear<br/>
Of Thunder and the Sword of <i>Michael</i><br/>
Wrought still within them; and no less desire<br/>
To found this nether Empire, which might rise<br/>
By pollicy, and long process of time,<br/>
In emulation opposite to Heav’n.<br/>
Which when <i>Beelzebub</i> perceiv’d, then whom,<br/>
<i>Satan</i> except, none higher sat, with grave<br/>
Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem’d<br/>
A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven<br/>
Deliberation sat and publick care;<br/>
And Princely counsel in his face yet shon,<br/>
Majestick though in ruin: sage he stood<br/>
With <i>Atlantean</i> shoulders fit to bear<br/>
The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look<br/>
Drew audience and attention still as Night<br/>
Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thrones and imperial Powers, off-spring of heav’n,<br/>
Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now<br/>
Must we renounce, and changing stile be call’d<br/>
Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote<br/>
Inclines, here to continue, and build up here<br/>
A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream,<br/>
And know not that the King of Heav’n hath doom’d<br/>
This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat<br/>
Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt<br/>
From Heav’ns high jurisdiction, in new League<br/>
Banded against his Throne, but to remaine<br/>
In strictest bondage, though thus far remov’d,<br/>
Under th’ inevitable curb, reserv’d<br/>
His captive multitude: For he, be sure,<br/>
In highth or depth, still first and last will Reign<br/>
Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part<br/>
By our revolt, but over Hell extend<br/>
His Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule<br/>
Us here, as with his Golden those in Heav’n.<br/>
What sit we then projecting Peace and Warr?<br/>
Warr hath determin’d us, and foild with loss<br/>
Irreparable; tearms of peace yet none<br/>
Voutsaf’t or sought; for what peace will be giv’n<br/>
To us enslav’d, but custody severe,<br/>
And stripes, and arbitrary punishment<br/>
Inflicted? and what peace can we return,<br/>
But to our power hostility and hate,<br/>
Untam’d reluctance, and revenge though slow,<br/>
Yet ever plotting how the Conquerour least<br/>
May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce<br/>
In doing what we most in suffering feel?<br/>
Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need<br/>
With dangerous expedition to invade<br/>
Heav’n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege,<br/>
Or ambush from the Deep.  What if we find<br/>
Some easier enterprize?  There is a place<br/>
(If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav’n<br/>
Err not) another World, the happy seat<br/>
Of som new Race call’d <i>Man</i>, about this time<br/>
To be created like to us, though less<br/>
In power and excellence, but favour’d more<br/>
Of him who rules above; so was his will<br/>
Pronounc’d among the Gods, and by an Oath,<br/>
That shook Heav’ns whol circumference, confirm’d.<br/>
Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn<br/>
What creatures there inhabit, of what mould,<br/>
Or substance, how endu’d, and what thir Power,<br/>
And where thir weakness, how attempted best,<br/>
By force or suttlety: Though Heav’n be shut,<br/>
And Heav’ns high Arbitrator sit secure<br/>
In his own strength, this place may lye expos’d<br/>
The utmost border of his Kingdom, left<br/>
To their defence who hold it: here perhaps<br/>
Som advantagious act may be achiev’d<br/>
By sudden onset, either with Hell fire<br/>
To waste his whole Creation, or possess<br/>
All as our own, and drive as we were driven,<br/>
The punie habitants, or if not drive,<br/>
Seduce them to our Party, that thir God<br/>
May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand<br/>
Abolish his own works.  This would surpass<br/>
Common revenge, and interrupt his joy<br/>
In our Confusion, and our Joy upraise<br/>
In his disturbance; when his darling Sons<br/>
Hurl’d headlong to partake with us, shall curse<br/>
Thir frail Originals, and faded bliss,<br/>
Faded so soon.  Advise if this be worth<br/>
Attempting, or to sit in darkness here<br/>
Hatching vain Empires.  Thus <i>Beelzebub</i><br/>
Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis’d<br/>
By <i>Satan</i>, and in part propos’d: for whence,<br/>
But from the Author of all ill could Spring<br/>
So deep a malice, to confound the race<br/>
Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell<br/>
To mingle and involve, done all to spite<br/>
The great Creatour?  But thir spite still serves<br/>
His glory to augment.  The bold design<br/>
Pleas’d highly those infernal States, and joy<br/>
Sparkl’d in all thir eyes; with full assent<br/>
They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews.<br/>

<p class="poem">
Well have ye judg’d, well ended long debate,<br/>
Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are,<br/>
Great things resolv’d; which from the lowest deep<br/>
Will once more lift us up, in spight of Fate,<br/>
Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view<br/>
Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms<br/>
And opportune excursion we may chance<br/>
Re-enter Heav’n; or else in some milde Zone<br/>
Dwell not unvisited of Heav’ns fair Light<br/>
Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam<br/>
Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air,<br/>
To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires<br/>
Shall breath her balme.  But first whom shall we send<br/>
In search of this new world, whom shall we find<br/>
Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet<br/>
The dark unbottom’d infinite Abyss<br/>
And through the palpable obscure find out<br/>
His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight<br/>
Upborn with indefatigable wings<br/>
Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive<br/>
The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then<br/>
Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe<br/>
Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick<br/>
Of Angels watching round?  Here he had need<br/>
All circumspection, and we now no less<br/>
Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send,<br/>
The weight of all and our last hope relies.<br/>

This said, he sat; and expectation held<br/>

Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; &amp; each<br/>
In others count’nance red his own dismay<br/>
Astonisht: none among the choice and prime<br/>
Of those Heav’n-warring Champions could be found<br/>
So hardie as to proffer or accept<br/>
Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last<br/>
<i>Satan</i>, whom now transcendent glory rais’d<br/>
Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride<br/>
Conscious of highest worth, unmov’d thus spake.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O Progeny of Heav’n, Empyreal Thrones,<br/>
With reason hath deep silence and demurr<br/>
Seis’d us, though undismaid: long is the way<br/>
And hard, that out of Hell leads up to Light;<br/>
Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire,<br/>
Outrageous to devour, immures us round<br/>
Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant<br/>
Barr’d over us prohibit all egress.<br/>
These past, if any pass, the void profound<br/>
Of unessential Night receives him next<br/>
Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being<br/>
Threatens him, plung’d in that abortive gulf.<br/>
If thence he scape into what ever world,<br/>
Or unknown Region, what remains him less<br/>
Then unknown dangers and as hard escape.<br/>
But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers,<br/>
And this Imperial Sov’ranty, adorn’d<br/>
With splendor, arm’d with power, if aught propos’d<br/>
And judg’d of public moment, in the shape<br/>
Of difficulty or danger could deterre<br/>
Me from attempting.  Wherefore do I assume<br/>
These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign,<br/>
Refusing to accept as great a share<br/>
Of hazard as of honour, due alike<br/>
To him who Reigns, and so much to him due<br/>
Of hazard more, as he above the rest<br/>
High honourd sits?  Go therfore mighty powers,<br/>
Terror of Heav’n, though fall’n; intend at home,<br/>
While here shall be our home, what best may ease<br/>
The present misery, and render Hell<br/>
More tollerable; if there be cure or charm<br/>
To respite or deceive, or slack the pain<br/>
Of this ill Mansion: intermit no watch<br/>
Against a wakeful Foe, while I abroad<br/>
Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek<br/>
Deliverance for us all: this enterprize<br/>
None shall partake with me.  Thus saying rose<br/>
The Monarch, and prevented all reply,<br/>
Prudent, least from his resolution rais’d<br/>
Others among the chief might offer now<br/>
(Certain to be refus’d) what erst they feard;<br/>
And so refus’d might in opinion stand<br/>
His rivals, winning cheap the high repute<br/>
Which he through hazard huge must earn.  But they<br/>
Dreaded not more th’ adventure then his voice<br/>
Forbidding; and at once with him they rose;<br/>
Thir rising all at once was as the sound<br/>
Of Thunder heard remote.  Towards him they bend<br/>
With awful reverence prone; and as a God<br/>
Extoll him equal to the highest in Heav’n:<br/>
Nor fail’d they to express how much they prais’d,<br/>
That for the general safety he despis’d<br/>
His own: for neither do the Spirits damn’d<br/>
Loose all thir vertue; least bad men should boast<br/>
Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites,<br/>
Or close ambition varnisht o’re with zeal.<br/>
Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark<br/>
Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief:<br/>
As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds<br/>
Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, o’respread<br/>
Heav’ns chearful face, the lowring Element<br/>
Scowls ore the dark’nd lantskip Snow, or showre;<br/>
If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet<br/>
Extend his ev’ning beam, the fields revive,<br/>
The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds<br/>
Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings.<br/>
O shame to men!  Devil with Devil damn’d<br/>
Firm concord holds, men onely disagree<br/>
Of Creatures rational, though under hope<br/>
Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace,<br/>
Yet live in hatred, enmitie, and strife<br/>
Among themselves, and levie cruel warres,<br/>
Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy:<br/>
As if (which might induce us to accord)<br/>
Man had not hellish foes anow besides,<br/>
That day and night for his destruction waite.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
The <i>Stygian</i> Councel thus dissolv’d; and forth<br/>
In order came the grand infernal Peers,<br/>
Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd<br/>
Alone th’ Antagonist of Heav’n, nor less<br/>
Then Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream,<br/>
And God-like imitated State; him round<br/>
A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos’d<br/>
With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms.<br/>
Then of thir Session ended they bid cry<br/>
With Trumpets regal sound the great result:<br/>
Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim<br/>
Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie<br/>
By Haralds voice explain’d: the hollow Abyss<br/>
Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell<br/>
With deafning shout, return’d them loud acclaim.<br/>
Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais’d<br/>
By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers<br/>
Disband, and wandring, each his several way<br/>
Pursues, as inclination or sad choice<br/>
Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find<br/>
Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain<br/>
The irksome hours, till his great Chief return.<br/>
Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime<br/>
Upon the wing, or in swift race contend,<br/>
As at th’ Olympian Games or <i>Pythian</i> fields;<br/>
Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal<br/>
With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form.<br/>
As when to warn proud Cities warr appears<br/>
Wag’d in the troubl’d Skie, and Armies rush<br/>
To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van<br/>
Pric forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir spears<br/>
Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms<br/>
From either end of Heav’n the welkin burns.<br/>
Others with vast <i>Typhoean</i> rage more fell<br/>
Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air<br/>
In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar.<br/>
As when <i>Alcides</i> from <i>Oealia</i> Crown’d<br/>
With conquest, felt th’ envenom’d robe, and tore<br/>
Through pain up by the roots <i>Thessalian</i> Pines,<br/>
And <i>Lichas</i> from the top of <i>Oeta</i> threw<br/>
Into th’ <i>Euboic</i> Sea.  Others more milde,<br/>
Retreated in a silent valley, sing<br/>
With notes Angelical to many a Harp<br/>
Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall<br/>
By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate<br/>
Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance.<br/>
Thir song was partial, but the harmony<br/>
(What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?)<br/>
Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment<br/>
The thronging audience.  In discourse more sweet<br/>
(For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,)<br/>
Others apart sat on a Hill retir’d,<br/>
In thoughts more elevate, and reason’d high<br/>
Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will, and Fate,<br/>
Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledge absolute,<br/>
And found no end, in wandring mazes lost.<br/>
Of good and evil much they argu’d then,<br/>
Of happiness and final misery,<br/>
Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame,<br/>
Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie:<br/>
Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm<br/>
Pain for a while or anguish, and excite<br/>
Fallacious hope, or arm th’ obdured brest<br/>
With stubborn patience as with triple steel.<br/>
Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands,<br/>
On bold adventure to discover wide<br/>
That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps<br/>
Might yeild them easier habitation, bend<br/>
Four ways thir flying March, along the Banks<br/>
Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge<br/>
Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams;<br/>
Abhorred <i>Styx</i> the flood of deadly hate,<br/>
Sad <i>Acheron</i> of sorrow, black and deep;<br/>
<i>Cocytus</i>, nam’d of lamentation loud<br/>
Heard on the ruful stream; fierce <i>Phlegeton</i><br/>
Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage.<br/>
Farr off from these a slow and silent stream,<br/>
<i>Lethe</i> the River of Oblivion roules<br/>
Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks,<br/>
Forthwith his former state and being forgets,<br/>
Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain.<br/>
Beyond this flood a frozen Continent<br/>
Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms<br/>
Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land<br/>
Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems<br/>
Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice,<br/>
A gulf profound as that <i>Serbonian</i> Bog<br/>
Betwixt <i>Damiata</i> and mount <i>Casius</i> old,<br/>
Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air<br/>
Burns frore, and cold performs th’ effect of Fire.<br/>
Thither by harpy-footed Furies hail’d,<br/>
At certain revolutions all the damn’d<br/>
Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change<br/>
Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce,<br/>
From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice<br/>
Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine<br/>
Immovable, infixt, and frozen round,<br/>
Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire.<br/>
They ferry over this <i>Lethean</i> Sound<br/>
Both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment,<br/>
And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach<br/>
The tempting stream, with one small drop to loose<br/>
In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe,<br/>
All in one moment, and so neer the brink;<br/>
But fate withstands, and to oppose th’ attempt<br/>
<i>Medusa</i> with <i>Gorgonian</i> terror guards<br/>
The Ford, and of it self the water flies<br/>
All taste of living wight, as once it fled<br/>
The lip of <i>Tantalus</i>.  Thus roving on<br/>
In confus’d march forlorn, th’ adventrous Bands<br/>
With shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast<br/>
View’d first thir lamentable lot, and found<br/>
No rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile<br/>
They pass’d, and many a Region dolorous,<br/>
O’re many a Frozen, many a Fierie Alpe,<br/>
Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death,<br/>
A Universe of death, which God by curse<br/>
Created evil, for evil only good,<br/>
Where all life dies, death lives, and nature breeds,<br/>
Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things,<br/>
Abominable, inutterable, and worse<br/>
Then Fables yet have feign’d, or fear conceiv’d,<br/>
<i>Gorgons</i> and <i>Hydra’s</i>, and <i>Chimera’s</i> dire.<br/>

<p class="poem">
Mean while the Adversary of God and Man,<br/>
<i>Satan</i> with thoughts inflam’d of highest design,<br/>
Puts on swift wings, and toward the Gates of Hell<br/>
Explores his solitary flight; som times<br/>
He scours the right hand coast, som times the left,<br/>
Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares<br/>
Up to the fiery concave touring high.<br/>
As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri’d<br/>
Hangs in the Clouds, by <i>Aequinoctial</i> Winds<br/>
Close sailing from <i>Bengala</i>, or the Iles<br/>
Of <i>Ternate</i> and <i>Tidore</i>, whence Merchants bring<br/>
Thir spicie Drugs: they on the trading Flood<br/>
Through the wide <i>Ethiopian</i> to the Cape<br/>
Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole.  So seem’d<br/>
Farr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer<br/>
Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof,<br/>
And thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass<br/>
Three Iron, three of Adamantine Rock,<br/>
Impenitrable, impal’d with circling fire,<br/>
Yet unconsum’d.  Before the Gates there sat<br/>
On either side a formidable shape;<br/>
The one seem’d Woman to the waste, and fair,<br/>
But ended foul in many a scaly fould<br/>
Voluminous and vast, a Serpent arm’d<br/>
With mortal sting: about her middle round<br/>
A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark’d<br/>
With wide <i>Cerberean</i> mouths full loud, and rung<br/>
A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep,<br/>
If aught disturb’d thir noyse, into her woomb,<br/>
And kennel there, yet there still bark’d and howl’d<br/>
Within unseen.  Farr less abhorrd then these<br/>
Vex’d <i>Scylla</i> bathing in the Sea that parts<br/>
<i>Calabria</i> from the hoarce <i>Trinacrian</i> shore:<br/>
Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call’d<br/>
In secret, riding through the Air she comes<br/>
Lur’d with the smell of infant blood, to dance<br/>
With <i>Lapland</i> Witches, while the labouring Moon<br/>
Eclipses at thir charms.  The other shape,<br/>
If shape it might be call’d that shape had none<br/>
Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb,<br/>
Or substance might be call’d that shadow seem’d,<br/>
For each seem’d either; black it stood as Night,<br/>
Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell,<br/>
And shook a dreadful Dart; what seem’d his head<br/>
The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on.<br/>
<i>Satan</i> was now at hand, and from his seat<br/>
The Monster moving onward came as fast,<br/>
With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode.<br/>
Th’ undaunted Fiend what this might be admir’d,<br/>
Admir’d, not fear’d; God and his Son except,<br/>
Created thing naught vallu’d he nor shun’d;<br/>
And with disdainful look thus first began.<br/>

Whence and what art thou, execrable shape,<br/>

<p class="poem">
To whom the Goblin full of wrauth reply’d,<br/>
Art thou that Traitor Angel, art thou hee,<br/>
Who first broke peace in Heav’n and Faith, till then<br/>
Unbrok’n, and in proud rebellious Arms<br/>
Drew after him the third part of Heav’ns Sons<br/>
Conjur’d against the highest, for which both Thou<br/>
And they outcast from God, are here condemn’d<br/>
To waste Eternal daies in woe and pain?<br/>
And reck’n’st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav’n,<br/>
Hell-doomd, and breath’st defiance here and scorn,<br/>
Where I reign King, and to enrage thee more,<br/>
Thy King and Lord?  Back to thy punishment,<br/>
False fugitive, and to thy speed add wings,<br/>
Least with a whip of Scorpions I pursue<br/>
Thy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart<br/>
Strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape,<br/>
So speaking and so threatning, grew ten fold<br/>
More dreadful and deform: on th’ other side<br/>
Incenc’t with indignation <i>Satan</i> stood<br/>
Unterrifi’d, and like a Comet burn’d,<br/>
That fires the length of <i>Ophiucus</i> huge<br/>
In th’ Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair<br/>
Shakes Pestilence and Warr.  Each at the Head<br/>
Level’d his deadly aime; thir fatall hands<br/>
No second stroke intend, and such a frown<br/>
Each cast at th’ other, as when two black Clouds<br/>
With Heav’ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on<br/>
Over the <i>Caspian</i>, then stand front to front<br/>
Hov’ring a space, till Winds the signal blow<br/>
To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air:<br/>
So frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell<br/>
Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood;<br/>
For never but once more was either like<br/>
To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds<br/>
Had been achiev’d, whereof all Hell had rung,<br/>
Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat<br/>
Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key,<br/>
Ris’n, and with hideous outcry rush’d between.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O Father, what intends thy hand, she cry’d,<br/>
Against thy only Son?  What fury O Son,<br/>
Possesses thee to bend that mortal Dart<br/>
Against thy Fathers head? and know’st for whom;<br/>
For him who sits above and laughs the while<br/>
At thee ordain’d his drudge, to execute<br/>
What e’re his wrath, which he calls Justice, bids,<br/>
His wrath which one day will destroy ye both.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest<br/>
Forbore, then these to her <i>Satan</i> return’d:<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange<br/>
Thou interposest, that my sudden hand<br/>
Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds<br/>
What it intends; till first I know of thee,<br/>
What thing thou art, thus double-form’d, and why<br/>
In this infernal Vaile first met thou call’st<br/>
Me Father, and that Fantasm call’st my Son?<br/>
I know thee not, nor ever saw till now<br/>
Sight more detestable then him and thee.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
T’ whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate reply’d;<br/>
Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem<br/>
Now in thine eye so foul, once deemd so fair<br/>
In Heav’n, when at th’ Assembly, and in sight<br/>
Of all the Seraphim with thee combin’d<br/>
In bold conspiracy against Heav’ns King,<br/>
All on a sudden miserable pain<br/>
Surpris’d thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm<br/>
In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast<br/>
Threw forth, till on the left side op’ning wide,<br/>
Likest to thee in shape and count’nance bright,<br/>
Then shining heav’nly fair, a Goddess arm’d<br/>
Out of thy head I sprung: amazement seis’d<br/>
All th’ Host of Heav’n; back they recoild affraid<br/>
At first, and call’d me <i>Sin</i>, and for a Sign<br/>
Portentous held me; but familiar grown,<br/>
I pleas’d, and with attractive graces won<br/>
The most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft<br/>
Thy self in me thy perfect image viewing<br/>
Becam’st enamour’d, and such joy thou took’st<br/>
With me in secret, that my womb conceiv’d<br/>
A growing burden.  Mean while Warr arose,<br/>
And fields were fought in Heav’n; wherein remaind<br/>
(For what could else) to our Almighty Foe<br/>
Cleer Victory, to our part loss and rout<br/>
Through all the Empyrean: down they fell<br/>
Driv’n headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down<br/>
Into this Deep, and in the general fall<br/>
I also; at which time this powerful Key<br/>
Into my hand was giv’n, with charge to keep<br/>
These Gates for ever shut, which none can pass<br/>
Without my op’ning.  Pensive here I sat<br/>
Alone, but long I sat not, till my womb<br/>
Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown<br/>
Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes.<br/>
At last this odious offspring whom thou seest<br/>
Thine own begotten, breaking violent way<br/>
Tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain<br/>
Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew<br/>
Transform’d: but he my inbred enemie<br/>
Forth issu’d, brandishing his fatal Dart<br/>
Made to destroy: I fled, and cry’d out <i>Death</i>;<br/>
Hell trembl’d at the hideous Name, and sigh’d<br/>
From all her Caves, and back resounded <i>Death</i>.<br/>
I fled, but he pursu’d (though more, it seems,<br/>
Inflam’d with lust then rage) and swifter far,<br/>
Me overtook his mother all dismaid,<br/>
And in embraces forcible and foule<br/>
Ingendring with me, of that rape begot<br/>
These yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry<br/>
Surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv’d<br/>
And hourly born, with sorrow infinite<br/>
To me, for when they list into the womb<br/>
That bred them they return, and howle and gnaw<br/>
My Bowels, their repast; then bursting forth<br/>
Afresh with conscious terrours vex me round,<br/>
That rest or intermission none I find.<br/>
Before mine eyes in opposition sits<br/>
Grim <i>Death</i> my Son and foe, who sets them on,<br/>
And me his Parent would full soon devour<br/>
For want of other prey, but that he knows<br/>
His end with mine involvd; and knows that I<br/>
Should prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane,<br/>
When ever that shall be; so Fate pronounc’d.<br/>
But thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun<br/>
His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope<br/>
To be invulnerable in those bright Arms,<br/>
Though temper’d heav’nly, for that mortal dint,<br/>
Save he who reigns above, none can resist.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
She finish’d, and the suttle Fiend his lore<br/>
Soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth.<br/>
Dear Daughter, since thou claim’st me for thy Sire,<br/>
And my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge<br/>
Of dalliance had with thee in Heav’n, and joys<br/>
Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change<br/>
Befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know<br/>
I come no enemie, but to set free<br/>
From out this dark and dismal house of pain,<br/>
Both him and thee, and all the heav’nly Host<br/>
Of Spirits that in our just pretenses arm’d<br/>
Fell with us from on high: from them I go<br/>
This uncouth errand sole, and one for all<br/>
My self expose, with lonely steps to tread<br/>
Th’ unfounded deep, &amp; through the void immense<br/>
To search with wandring quest a place foretold<br/>
Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now<br/>
Created vast and round, a place of bliss<br/>
In the Pourlieues of Heav’n, and therein plac’t<br/>
A race of upstart Creatures, to supply<br/>
Perhaps our vacant room, though more remov’d,<br/>
Least Heav’n surcharg’d with potent multitude<br/>
Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught<br/>
Then this more secret now design’d, I haste<br/>
To know, and this once known, shall soon return,<br/>
And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death<br/>
Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen<br/>
Wing silently the buxom Air, imbalm’d<br/>
With odours; there ye shall be fed and fill’d<br/>
Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey.<br/>
He ceas’d, for both seemd highly pleasd, and Death<br/>
Grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear<br/>
His famine should be fill’d, and blest his mawe<br/>
Destin’d to that good hour: no less rejoyc’d<br/>
His mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
The key of this infernal Pit by due,<br/>
And by command of Heav’ns all-powerful King<br/>
I keep, by him forbidden to unlock<br/>
These Adamantine Gates; against all force<br/>
Death ready stands to interpose his dart,<br/>
Fearless to be o’rematcht by living might.<br/>
But what ow I to his commands above<br/>
Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down<br/>
Into this gloom of <i>Tartarus</i> profound,<br/>
To sit in hateful Office here confin’d,<br/>
Inhabitant of Heav’n, and heav’nlie-born,<br/>
Here in perpetual agonie and pain,<br/>
With terrors and with clamors compasst round<br/>
Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed:<br/>
Thou art my Father, thou my Author, thou<br/>
My being gav’st me; whom should I obey<br/>
But thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon<br/>
To that new world of light and bliss, among<br/>
The Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign<br/>
At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems<br/>
Thy daughter and thy darling, without end.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thus saying, from her side the fatal Key,<br/>
Sad instrument of all our woe, she took;<br/>
And towards the Gate rouling her bestial train,<br/>
Forthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew,<br/>
Which but her self not all the <i>Stygian</i> powers<br/>
Could once have mov’d; then in the key-hole turns<br/>
Th’ intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar<br/>
Of massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease<br/>
Unfast’ns: on a sudden op’n flie<br/>
With impetuous recoile and jarring sound<br/>
Th’ infernal dores, and on thir hinges great<br/>
Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook<br/>
Of <i>Erebus</i>.  She op’nd, but to shut<br/>
Excel’d her power; the Gates wide op’n stood,<br/>
That with extended wings a Bannerd Host<br/>
Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through<br/>
With Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array;<br/>
So wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth<br/>
Cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame.<br/>
Before thir eyes in sudden view appear<br/>
The secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark<br/>
Illimitable Ocean without bound,<br/>
Without dimension, where length, breadth, and highth,<br/>
And time and place are lost; where eldest Night<br/>
And <i>Chaos</i>, Ancestors of Nature, hold<br/>
Eternal <i>Anarchie</i>, amidst the noise<br/>
Of endless warrs and by confusion stand.<br/>
For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce<br/>
Strive here for Maistrie, and to Battel bring<br/>
Thir embryon Atoms; they around the flag<br/>
Of each his faction, in thir several Clanns,<br/>
Light-arm’d or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow,<br/>
Swarm populous, unnumber’d as the Sands<br/>
Of <i>Barca</i> or <i>Cyrene’s</i> torrid soil,<br/>
Levied to side with warring Winds, and poise<br/>
Thir lighter wings.  To whom these most adhere,<br/>
Hee rules a moment; <i>Chaos</i> Umpire sits,<br/>
And by decision more imbroiles the fray<br/>
By which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter<br/>
<i>Chance</i> governs all.  Into this wilde Abyss,<br/>
The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave,<br/>
Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire,<br/>
But all these in thir pregnant causes mixt<br/>
Confus’dly, and which thus must ever fight,<br/>
Unless th’ Almighty Maker them ordain<br/>
His dark materials to create more Worlds,<br/>
Into this wilde Abyss the warie fiend<br/>
Stood on the brink of Hell and look’d a while,<br/>
Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith<br/>
He had to cross.  Nor was his eare less peal’d<br/>
With noises loud and ruinous (to compare<br/>
Great things with small) then when <i>Bellona</i> storms,<br/>
With all her battering Engines bent to rase<br/>
Som Capital City, or less then if this frame<br/>
Of Heav’n were falling, and these Elements<br/>
In mutinie had from her Axle torn<br/>
The stedfast Earth.  At last his Sail-broad Vannes<br/>
He spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak<br/>
Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League<br/>
As in a cloudy Chair ascending rides<br/>
Audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets<br/>
A vast vacuitie: all unawares<br/>
Fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops<br/>
Ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour<br/>
Down had been falling, had not by ill chance<br/>
The strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud<br/>
Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him<br/>
As many miles aloft: that furie stay’d,<br/>
Quencht in a Boggie <i>Syrtris</i>, neither Sea,<br/>
Nor good dry Land: nigh founderd on he fares,<br/>
Treading the crude consistence, half on foot,<br/>
Half flying; behoves him now both Oare and Saile.<br/>
As when a Gryfon through the Wilderness<br/>
With winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale,<br/>
Pursues the <i>Arimaspian</i>, who by stelth<br/>
Had from his wakeful custody purloind<br/>
The guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend<br/>
Ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare,<br/>
With head, hands, wings, or feet pursues his way,<br/>
And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes:<br/>
At length a universal hubbub wilde<br/>
Of stunning sounds and voices all confus’d<br/>
Born through the hollow dark assaults his eare<br/>
With loudest vehemence: thither he plyes,<br/>
Undaunted to meet there what ever power<br/>
Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss<br/>
Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask<br/>
Which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes<br/>
Bordering on light; when strait behold the Throne<br/>
Of <i>Chaos</i>, and his dark Pavilion spread<br/>
Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthron’d<br/>
Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things,<br/>
The consort of his Reign; and by them stood<br/>
<i>Orcus</i> and <i>Ades</i>, and the dreaded name<br/>
Of <i>Demogorgon</i>; Rumor next and Chance,<br/>
And Tumult and Confusion all imbroild,<br/>
And Discord with a thousand various mouths.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
T’ whom <i>Satan</i> turning boldly, thus.  Ye Powers<br/>
And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss,<br/>
<i>Chaos</i> and <i>Ancient Night</i>, I come no Spie,<br/>
With purpose to explore or to disturb<br/>
The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint<br/>
Wandring this darksome desart, as my way<br/>
Lies through your spacious Empire up to light,<br/>
Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek<br/>
What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds<br/>
Confine with Heav’n; or if som other place<br/>
From your Dominion won, th’ Ethereal King<br/>
Possesses lately, thither to arrive<br/>
I travel this profound, direct my course;<br/>
Directed, no mean recompence it brings<br/>
To your behoof, if I that Region lost,<br/>
All usurpation thence expell’d, reduce<br/>
To her original darkness and your sway<br/>
(Which is my present journey) and once more<br/>
Erect the Standerd there of <i>Ancient Night</i>;<br/>
Yours be th’ advantage all, mine the revenge.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thus <i>Satan</i>; and him thus the Anarch old<br/>
With faultring speech and visage incompos’d<br/>
Answer’d.  I know thee, stranger, who thou art,<br/>
That mighty leading Angel, who of late<br/>
Made head against Heav’ns King, though overthrown.<br/>
I saw and heard, for such a numerous host<br/>
Fled not in silence through the frighted deep<br/>
With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout,<br/>
Confusion worse confounded; and Heav’n Gates<br/>
Pourd out by millions her victorious Bands<br/>
Pursuing.  I upon my Frontieres here<br/>
Keep residence; if all I can will serve,<br/>
That little which is left so to defend<br/>
Encroacht on still through our intestine broiles<br/>
Weakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell<br/>
Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath;<br/>
Now lately Heaven and Earth, another World<br/>
Hung ore my Realm, link’d in a golden Chain<br/>
To that side Heav’n from whence your Legions fell:<br/>
If that way be your walk, you have not farr;<br/>
So much the neerer danger; goe and speed;<br/>
Havock and spoil and ruin are my gain.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
He ceas’d; and <i>Satan</i> staid not to reply,<br/>
But glad that now his Sea should find a shore,<br/>
With fresh alacritie and force renew’d<br/>
Springs upward like a Pyramid of fire<br/>
Into the wilde expanse, and through the shock<br/>
Of fighting Elements, on all sides round<br/>
Environ’d wins his way; harder beset<br/>
And more endanger’d, then when <i>Argo</i> pass’d<br/>
Through <i>Bosporus</i> betwixt the justling Rocks:<br/>
Or when <i>Ulysses</i> on the Larbord shunnd<br/>
<i>Charybdis</i>, and by th’ other whirlpool steard.<br/>
So he with difficulty and labour hard<br/>
Mov’d on, with difficulty and labour hee;<br/>
But hee once past, soon after when man fell,<br/>
Strange alteration!  Sin and Death amain<br/>
Following his track, such was the will of Heav’n,<br/>
Pav’d after him a broad and beat’n way<br/>
Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf<br/>
Tamely endur’d a Bridge of wondrous length<br/>
From Hell continu’d reaching th’ utmost Orbe<br/>
Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse<br/>
With easie intercourse pass to and fro<br/>
To tempt or punish mortals, except whom<br/>
God and good Angels guard by special grace.<br/>
But now at last the sacred influence<br/>
Of light appears, and from the walls of Heav’n<br/>
Shoots farr into the bosom of dim Night<br/>
A glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins<br/>
Her fardest verge, and <i>Chaos</i> to retire<br/>
As from her outmost works a brok’n foe<br/>
With tumult less and with less hostile din,<br/>
That <i>Satan</i> with less toil, and now with ease<br/>
Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light<br/>
And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds<br/>
Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn;<br/>
Or in the emptier waste, resembling Air,<br/>
Weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold<br/>
Farr off th’ Empyreal Heav’n, extended wide<br/>
In circuit, undetermind square or round,<br/>
With Opal Towrs and Battlements adorn’d<br/>
Of living Saphire, once his native Seat;<br/>
And fast by hanging in a golden Chain<br/>
This pendant world, in bigness as a Starr<br/>
Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon.<br/>
Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge,<br/>
Accurst, and in a cursed hour he hies.<br/>

<h3>  BOOK III.</h3>
<p class="pfirst">
<span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>ail holy light, ofspring of Heav’n first-born,<br/>
Or of th’ Eternal Coeternal beam<br/>
May I express thee unblam’d? since God is light,<br/>
And never but in unapproached light<br/>
Dwelt from Eternitie, dwelt then in thee,<br/>
Bright effluence of bright essence increate.<br/>
Or hear’st thou rather pure Ethereal stream,<br/>
Whose Fountain who shall tell? before the Sun,<br/>
Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice<br/>
Of God, as with a Mantle didst invest<br/>
The rising world of waters dark and deep,<br/>
Won from the void and formless infinite.<br/>
Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing,<br/>
Escap’t the <i>Stygian</i> Pool, though long detain’d<br/>
In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight<br/>
Through utter and through middle darkness borne<br/>
With other notes then to th’ <i>Orphean</i> Lyre<br/>
I sung of <i>Chaos</i> and <i>Eternal Night</i>,<br/>
Taught by the heav’nly Muse to venture down<br/>
The dark descent, and up to reascend,<br/>
Though hard and rare: thee I revisit safe,<br/>
And feel thy sovran vital Lamp; but thou<br/>
Revisit’st not these eyes, that rowle in vain<br/>
To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;<br/>
So thick a drop serene hath quencht thir Orbs,<br/>
Or dim suffusion veild.  Yet not the more<br/>
Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt<br/>
Cleer Spring, or shadie Grove, or Sunnie Hill,<br/>
Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief<br/>
Thee <i>Sion</i> and the flowrie Brooks beneath<br/>
That wash thy hallowd feet, and warbling flow,<br/>
Nightly I visit: nor somtimes forget<br/>
Those other two equal’d with me in Fate,<br/>
So were I equal’d with them in renown,<br/>
Blind <i>Thamyris</i> and blind <i>Maeonides</i>,<br/>
And <i>Tiresias</i> and <i>Phineus</i> Prophets old.<br/>
Then feed on thoughts, that voluntarie move<br/>
Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful Bird<br/>
Sings darkling, and in shadiest Covert hid<br/>
Tunes her nocturnal Note.  Thus with the Year<br/>
Seasons return, but not to me returns<br/>
Day, or the sweet approach of Ev’n or Morn,<br/>
Or sight of vernal bloom, or Summers Rose,<br/>
Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine;<br/>
But cloud in stead, and ever-during dark<br/>
Surrounds me, from the chearful waies of men<br/>
Cut off, and for the book of knowledg fair<br/>
Presented with a Universal blanc<br/>
Of Natures works to mee expung’d and ras’d,<br/>
And wisdome at one entrance quite shut out.<br/>
So much the rather thou Celestial light<br/>
Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers<br/>
Irradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence<br/>
Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell<br/>
Of things invisible to mortal sight.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Now had the Almighty Father from above,<br/>
From the pure Empyrean where he sits<br/>
High Thron’d above all highth, bent down his eye,<br/>
His own works and their works at once to view:<br/>
About him all the Sanctities of Heaven<br/>
Stood thick as Starrs, and from his sight receiv’d<br/>
Beatitude past utterance; on his right<br/>
The radiant image of his Glory sat,<br/>
His onely Son; On Earth he first beheld<br/>
Our two first Parents, yet the onely two<br/>
Of mankind, in the happie Garden plac’t,<br/>
Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love,<br/>
Uninterrupted joy, unrivald love<br/>
In blissful solitude; he then survey’d<br/>
Hell and the Gulf between, and <i>Satan</i> there<br/>
Coasting the wall of Heav’n on this side Night<br/>
In the dun Air sublime, and ready now<br/>
To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet<br/>
On the bare outside of this World, that seem’d<br/>
Firm land imbosom’d without Firmament,<br/>
Uncertain which, in Ocean or in Air.<br/>
Him God beholding from his prospect high,<br/>
Wherein past, present, future he beholds,<br/>
Thus to his onely Son foreseeing spake.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Onely begotten Son, seest thou what rage<br/>
Transports our adversarie, whom no bounds<br/>
Prescrib’d, no barrs of Hell, nor all the chains<br/>
Heapt on him there, nor yet the main Abyss<br/>
Wide interrupt can hold; so bent he seems<br/>
On desperat revenge, that shall redound<br/>
Upon his own rebellious head.  And now<br/>
Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way<br/>
Not farr off Heav’n, in the Precincts of light,<br/>
Directly towards the new created World,<br/>
And Man there plac’t, with purpose to assay<br/>
If him by force he can destroy, or worse,<br/>
By som false guile pervert; and shall pervert;<br/>
For man will heark’n to his glozing lyes,<br/>
And easily transgress the sole Command,<br/>
Sole pledge of his obedience: So will fall<br/>
Hee and his faithless Progenie: whose fault?<br/>
Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of mee<br/>
All he could have; I made him just and right,<br/>
Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall.<br/>
Such I created all th’ Ethereal Powers<br/>
And Spirits, both them who stood &amp; them who faild;<br/>
Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell.<br/>
Not free, what proof could they have givn sincere<br/>
Of true allegiance, constant Faith or Love,<br/>
Where onely what they needs must do, appeard,<br/>
Not what they would? what praise could they receive?<br/>
What pleasure I from such obedience paid,<br/>
When Will and Reason (Reason also is choice)<br/>
Useless and vain, of freedom both despoild,<br/>
Made passive both, had servd necessitie,<br/>
Not mee.  They therefore as to right belongd,<br/>
So were created, nor can justly accuse<br/>
Thir maker, or thir making, or thir Fate;<br/>
As if Predestination over-rul’d<br/>
Thir will, dispos’d by absolute Decree<br/>
Or high foreknowledge; they themselves decreed<br/>
Thir own revolt, not I: if I foreknew,<br/>
Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault,<br/>
Which had no less prov’d certain unforeknown.<br/>
So without least impulse or shadow of Fate,<br/>
Or aught by me immutablie foreseen,<br/>
They trespass, Authors to themselves in all<br/>
Both what they judge and what they choose; for so<br/>
I formd them free, and free they must remain,<br/>
Till they enthrall themselves: I else must change<br/>
Thir nature, and revoke the high Decree<br/>
Unchangeable, Eternal, which ordain’d<br/>
Thir freedom, they themselves ordain’d thir fall.<br/>
The first sort by thir own suggestion fell,<br/>
Self-tempted, self-deprav’d: Man falls deceiv’d<br/>
By the other first: Man therefore shall find grace,<br/>
The other none: in Mercy and Justice both,<br/>
Through Heav’n and Earth, so shall my glorie excel,<br/>
But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill’d<br/>
All Heav’n, and in the blessed Spirits elect<br/>
Sense of new joy ineffable diffus’d:<br/>
Beyond compare the Son of God was seen<br/>
Most glorious, in him all his Father shon<br/>
Substantially express’d, and in his face<br/>
Divine compassion visibly appeerd,<br/>
Love without end, and without measure Grace,<br/>
Which uttering thus he to his Father spake.<br/>

O Father, gracious was that word which clos’d<br/>
Thy sovran sentence, that Man should find grace;<br/>
For which both Heav’n and Earth shall high extoll<br/>
Thy praises, with th’ innumerable sound<br/>
Of Hymns and sacred Songs, wherewith thy Throne<br/>
Encompass’d shall resound thee ever blest.<br/>
For should Man finally be lost, should Man<br/>
Thy creature late so lov’d, thy youngest Son<br/>
Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though joynd<br/>
With his own folly? that be from thee farr,<br/>
That farr be from thee, Father, who art Judge<br/>
Of all things made, and judgest onely right.<br/>
Or shall the Adversarie thus obtain<br/>
His end, and frustrate thine, shall he fulfill<br/>
His malice, and thy goodness bring to naught,<br/>
Or proud return though to his heavier doom,<br/>
Yet with revenge accomplish’t and to Hell<br/>
Draw after him the whole Race of mankind,<br/>
By him corrupted? or wilt thou thy self<br/>
Abolish thy Creation, and unmake,<br/>
For him, what for thy glorie thou hast made?<br/>
So should thy goodness and thy greatness both<br/>
Be questiond and blaspheam’d without defence.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
To whom the great Creatour thus reply’d.<br/>
O Son, in whom my Soul hath chief delight,<br/>
Son of my bosom, Son who art alone<br/>
My word, my wisdom, and effectual might,<br/>
All hast thou spok’n as my thoughts are, all<br/>
As my Eternal purpose hath decreed:<br/>
Man shall not quite be lost, but sav’d who will,<br/>
Yet not of will in him, but grace in me<br/>
Freely voutsaft; once more I will renew<br/>
His lapsed powers, though forfeit and enthrall’d<br/>
By sin to foul exorbitant desires;<br/>
Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand<br/>
On even ground against his mortal foe,<br/>
By me upheld, that he may know how frail<br/>
His fall’n condition is, and to me ow<br/>
All his deliv’rance, and to none but me.<br/>
Some I have chosen of peculiar grace<br/>
Elect above the rest; so is my will:<br/>
The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warnd<br/>
Thir sinful state, and to appease betimes<br/>
Th’ incensed Deitie, while offerd grace<br/>
Invites; for I will cleer thir senses dark,<br/>
What may suffice, and soft’n stonie hearts<br/>
To pray, repent, and bring obedience due.<br/>
To prayer, repentance, and obedience due,<br/>
Though but endevord with sincere intent,<br/>
Mine eare shall not be slow, mine eye not shut.<br/>
And I will place within them as a guide<br/>
My Umpire <i>Conscience</i>, whom if they will hear,<br/>
Light after light well us’d they shall attain,<br/>
And to the end persisting, safe arrive.<br/>
This my long sufferance and my day of grace<br/>
They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste;<br/>
But hard be hard’nd, blind be blinded more,<br/>
That they may stumble on, and deeper fall;<br/>
And none but such from mercy I exclude.<br/>
But yet all is not don; Man disobeying,<br/>
Disloyal breaks his fealtie, and sinns<br/>
Against the high Supremacie of Heav’n,<br/>
Affecting God-head, and so loosing all,<br/>
To expiate his Treason hath naught left,<br/>
But to destruction sacred and devote,<br/>
He with his whole posteritie must die,<br/>
Die hee or Justice must; unless for him<br/>
Som other able, and as willing, pay<br/>
The rigid satisfaction, death for death.<br/>
Say Heav’nly Powers, where shall we find such love,<br/>
Which of ye will be mortal to redeem<br/>
Mans mortal crime, and just th’ unjust to save,<br/>
Dwels in all Heaven charitie so deare?<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
He ask’d, but all the Heav’nly Quire stood mute,<br/>
And silence was in Heav’n: on mans behalf<br/>
Patron or Intercessor none appeerd,<br/>
Much less that durst upon his own head draw<br/>
The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set.<br/>
And now without redemption all mankind<br/>
Must have bin lost, adjudg’d to Death and Hell<br/>
By doom severe, had not the Son of God,<br/>
In whom the fulness dwels of love divine,<br/>
His dearest mediation thus renewd.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Father, thy word is past, man shall find grace;<br/>
And shall grace not find means, that finds her way,<br/>
The speediest of thy winged messengers,<br/>
To visit all thy creatures, and to all<br/>
Comes unprevented, unimplor’d, unsought,<br/>
Happie for man, so coming; he her aide<br/>
Can never seek, once dead in sins and lost;<br/>
Attonement for himself or offering meet,<br/>
Indebted and undon, hath none to bring:<br/>
Behold mee then, mee for him, life for life<br/>
I offer, on mee let thine anger fall;<br/>
Account mee man; I for his sake will leave<br/>
Thy bosom, and this glorie next to thee<br/>
Freely put off, and for him lastly die<br/>
Well pleas’d, on me let Death wreck all his rage;<br/>
Under his gloomie power I shall not long<br/>
Lie vanquisht; thou hast givn me to possess<br/>
Life in my self for ever, by thee I live,<br/>
Though now to Death I yeild, and am his due<br/>
All that of me can die, yet that debt paid,<br/>
Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsom grave<br/>
His prey, nor suffer my unspotted Soule<br/>
For ever with corruption there to dwell;<br/>
But I shall rise Victorious, and subdue<br/>
My Vanquisher, spoild of his vanted spoile;<br/>
Death his deaths wound shall then receive, &amp; stoop<br/>
Inglorious, of his mortall sting disarm’d.<br/>
I through the ample Air in Triumph high<br/>
Shall lead Hell Captive maugre Hell, and show<br/>
The powers of darkness bound.  Thou at the sight<br/>
Pleas’d, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile,<br/>
While by thee rais’d I ruin all my Foes,<br/>
Death last, and with his Carcass glut the Grave:<br/>
Then with the multitude of my redeemd<br/>
Shall enter Heaven long absent, and returne,<br/>
Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud<br/>
Of anger shall remain, but peace assur’d,<br/>
And reconcilement; wrauth shall be no more<br/>
Thenceforth, but in thy presence Joy entire.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
His words here ended, but his meek aspect<br/>
Silent yet spake, and breath’d immortal love<br/>
To mortal men, above which only shon<br/>
Filial obedience: as a sacrifice<br/>
Glad to be offer’d, he attends the will<br/>
Of his great Father.  Admiration seis’d<br/>
All Heav’n, what this might mean, &amp; whither tend<br/>
Wondring; but soon th’ Almighty thus reply’d:<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O thou in Heav’n and Earth the only peace<br/>
Found out for mankind under wrauth, O thou<br/>
My sole complacence! well thou know’st how dear,<br/>
To me are all my works, nor Man the least<br/>
Though last created, that for him I spare<br/>
Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save,<br/>
By loosing thee a while, the whole Race lost.<br/>
Thou therefore whom thou only canst redeeme,<br/>
Thir Nature also to thy Nature joyne;<br/>
And be thy self Man among men on Earth,<br/>
Made flesh, when time shall be, of Virgin seed,<br/>
By wondrous birth: Be thou in <i>Adams</i> room<br/>
The Head of all mankind, though <i>Adams</i> Son.<br/>
As in him perish all men, so in thee<br/>
As from a second root shall be restor’d,<br/>
As many as are restor’d, without thee none.<br/>
His crime makes guiltie all his Sons, thy merit<br/>
Imputed shall absolve them who renounce<br/>
Thir own both righteous and unrighteous deeds,<br/>
And live in thee transplanted, and from thee<br/>
Receive new life.  So Man, as is most just,<br/>
Shall satisfie for Man, be judg’d and die,<br/>
And dying rise, and rising with him raise<br/>
His Brethren, ransomd with his own dear life.<br/>
So Heav’nly love shal outdoo Hellish hate,<br/>
Giving to death, and dying to redeeme,<br/>
So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate<br/>
So easily destroy’d, and still destroyes<br/>
In those who, when they may, accept not grace.<br/>
Nor shalt thou by descending to assume<br/>
Mans Nature, less’n or degrade thine owne.<br/>
Because thou hast, though Thron’d in highest bliss<br/>
Equal to God, and equally enjoying<br/>
God-like fruition, quitted all to save<br/>
A World from utter loss, and hast been found<br/>
By Merit more then Birthright Son of God,<br/>
Found worthiest to be so by being Good,<br/>
Farr more then Great or High; because in thee<br/>
Love hath abounded more then Glory abounds,<br/>
Therefore thy Humiliation shall exalt<br/>
With thee thy Manhood also to this Throne;<br/>
Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt Reigne<br/>
Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man,<br/>
Anointed universal King; all Power<br/>
I give thee, reign for ever, and assume<br/>
Thy Merits; under thee as Head Supream<br/>
Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions I reduce:<br/>
All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide<br/>
In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell;<br/>
When thou attended gloriously from Heav’n<br/>
Shalt in the Skie appeer, and from thee send<br/>
The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaime<br/>
Thy dread Tribunal: forthwith from all Windes<br/>
The living, and forthwith the cited dead<br/>
Of all past Ages to the general Doom<br/>
Shall hast’n, such a peal shall rouse thir sleep.<br/>
Then all thy Saints assembl’d, thou shalt judge<br/>
Bad men and Angels, they arraignd shall sink<br/>
Beneath thy Sentence; Hell, her numbers full,<br/>
Thenceforth shall be for ever shut.  Mean while<br/>
The World shall burn, and from her ashes spring<br/>
New Heav’n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell<br/>
And after all thir tribulations long<br/>
See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds,<br/>
With Joy and Love triumphing, and fair Truth.<br/>
Then thou thy regal Scepter shalt lay by,<br/>
For regal Scepter then no more shall need,<br/>
God shall be All in All.  But all ye Gods,<br/>
Adore him, who to compass all this dies,<br/>
Adore the Son, and honour him as mee.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
No sooner had th’ Almighty ceas’t, but all<br/>
The multitude of Angels with a shout<br/>
Loud as from numbers without number, sweet<br/>
As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heav’n rung<br/>
With Jubilee, and loud Hosanna’s fill’d<br/>
Th’ eternal Regions: lowly reverent<br/>
Towards either Throne they bow, &amp; to the ground<br/>
With solemn adoration down they cast<br/>
Thir Crowns inwove with Amarant and Gold,<br/>
Immortal Amarant, a Flour which once<br/>
In Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life<br/>
Began to bloom, but soon for mans offence<br/>
To Heav’n remov’d where first it grew, there grows,<br/>
And flours aloft shading the Fount of Life,<br/>
And where the river of Bliss through midst of Heavn<br/>
Rowls o’re <i>Elisian</i> Flours her Amber stream;<br/>
With these that never fade the Spirits Elect<br/>
Bind thir resplendent locks inwreath’d with beams,<br/>
Now in loose Garlands thick thrown off, the bright<br/>
Pavement that like a Sea of Jasper shon<br/>
Impurpl’d with Celestial Roses smil’d.<br/>
Then Crown’d again thir gold’n Harps they took,<br/>
Harps ever tun’d, that glittering by their side<br/>
Like Quivers hung, and with Praeamble sweet<br/>
Of charming symphonie they introduce<br/>
Thir sacred Song, and waken raptures high;<br/>
No voice exempt, no voice but well could joine<br/>
Melodious part, such concord is in Heav’n.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent,<br/>
Immutable, Immortal, Infinite,<br/>
Eternal King; thee Author of all being,<br/>
Fountain of Light, thy self invisible<br/>
Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit’st<br/>
Thron’d inaccessible, but when thou shad’st<br/>
The full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud<br/>
Drawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine,<br/>
Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appeer,<br/>
Yet dazle Heav’n, that brightest Seraphim<br/>
Approach not, but with both wings veil thir eyes.<br/>
Thee next they sang of all Creation first,<br/>
Begotten Son, Divine Similitude,<br/>
In whose conspicuous count’nance, without cloud<br/>
Made visible, th’ Almighty Father shines,<br/>
Whom else no Creature can behold; on thee<br/>
Impresst the effulgence of his Glorie abides,<br/>
Transfus’d on thee his ample Spirit rests.<br/>
Hee Heav’n of Heavens and all the Powers therein<br/>
By thee created, and by thee threw down<br/>
Th’ aspiring Dominations: thou that day<br/>
Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder didst not spare,<br/>
Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that shook<br/>
Heav’ns everlasting Frame, while o’re the necks<br/>
Thou drov’st of warring Angels disarraid.<br/>
Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaime<br/>
Thee only extold, Son of thy Fathers might,<br/>
To execute fierce vengeance on his foes,<br/>
Not so on Man; him through their malice fall’n,<br/>
Father of Mercie and Grace, thou didst not doome<br/>
So strictly, but much more to pitie encline:<br/>
No sooner did thy dear and onely Son<br/>
Perceive thee purpos’d not to doom frail Man<br/>
So strictly, but much more to pitie enclin’d,<br/>
He to appease thy wrauth, and end the strife<br/>
Of Mercy and Justice in thy face discern’d,<br/>
Regardless of the Bliss wherein hee sat<br/>
Second to thee, offerd himself to die<br/>
For mans offence.  O unexampl’d love,<br/>
Love no where to be found less then Divine!<br/>
Hail Son of God, Saviour of Men, thy Name<br/>
Shall be the copious matter of my Song<br/>
Henceforth, and never shall my Harp thy praise<br/>
Forget, nor from thy Fathers praise disjoine.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thus they in Heav’n, above the starry Sphear,<br/>
Thir happie hours in joy and hymning spent.<br/>
Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe<br/>
Of this round World, whose first convex divides<br/>
The luminous inferior Orbs, enclos’d<br/>
From <i>Chaos</i> and th’ inroad of Darkness old,<br/>
<i>Satan</i> alighted walks: a Globe farr off<br/>
It seem’d, now seems a boundless Continent<br/>
Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night<br/>
Starless expos’d, and ever-threatning storms<br/>
Of <i>Chaos</i> blustring round, inclement skie;<br/>
Save on that side which from the wall of Heav’n<br/>
Though distant farr som small reflection gaines<br/>
Of glimmering air less vext with tempest loud:<br/>
Here walk’d the Fiend at large in spacious field.<br/>
As when a Vultur on <i>Imaus</i> bred,<br/>
Whose snowie ridge the roving <i>Tartar</i> bounds,<br/>
Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey<br/>
To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids<br/>
On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs<br/>
Of <i>Ganges</i> or <i>Hydaspes, Indian</i> streams;<br/>
But in his way lights on the barren plaines<br/>
Of <i>Sericana</i>, where <i>Chineses</i> drive<br/>
With Sails and Wind thir canie Waggons light:<br/>
So on this windie Sea of Land, the Fiend<br/>
Walk’d up and down alone bent on his prey,<br/>
Alone, for other Creature in this place<br/>
Living or liveless to be found was none,<br/>
None yet, but store hereafter from the earth<br/>
Up hither like Aereal vapours flew<br/>
Of all things transitorie and vain, when Sin<br/>
With vanity had filld the works of men:<br/>
Both all things vain, and all who in vain things<br/>
Built thir fond hopes of Glorie or lasting fame,<br/>
Or happiness in this or th’ other life;<br/>
All who have thir reward on Earth, the fruits<br/>
Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal,<br/>
Naught seeking but the praise of men, here find<br/>
Fit retribution, emptie as thir deeds;<br/>
All th’ unaccomplisht works of Natures hand,<br/>
Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixt,<br/>
Dissolvd on earth, fleet hither, and in vain,<br/>
Till final dissolution, wander here,<br/>
Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamd;<br/>
Those argent Fields more likely habitants,<br/>
Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold<br/>
Betwixt th’ Angelical and Human kinde:<br/>
Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born<br/>
First from the ancient World those Giants came<br/>
With many a vain exploit, though then renownd:<br/>
The builders next of <i>Babel</i> on the Plain<br/>
Of <i>Sennaar</i>, and still with vain designe<br/>
New <i>Babels</i>, had they wherewithall, would build:<br/>
Others came single; hee who to be deemd<br/>
A God, leap’d fondly into <i>Aetna</i> flames,<br/>
<i>Empedocles</i>, and hee who to enjoy<br/>
<i>Plato’s Elysium</i>, leap’d into the Sea,<br/>
<i>Cleombrotus</i>, and many more too long,<br/>
Embryo’s and Idiots, Eremits and Friers<br/>
White, Black and Grey, with all thir trumperie.<br/>
Here Pilgrims roam, that stray’d so farr to seek<br/>
In <i>Golgotha</i> him dead, who lives in Heav’n;<br/>
And they who to be sure of Paradise<br/>
Dying put on the weeds of <i>Dominic</i>,<br/>
Or in <i>Franciscan</i> think to pass disguis’d;<br/>
They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixt,<br/>
And that Crystalline Sphear whose ballance weighs<br/>
The Trepidation talkt, and that first mov’d;<br/>
And now Saint <i>Peter</i> at Heav’ns Wicket seems<br/>
To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot<br/>
Of Heav’ns ascent they lift thir Feet, when loe<br/>
A violent cross wind from either Coast<br/>
Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry<br/>
Into the devious Air; then might ye see<br/>
Cowles, Hoods and Habits with thir wearers tost<br/>
And flutterd into Raggs, then Reliques, Beads,<br/>
Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls,<br/>
The sport of Winds: all these upwhirld aloft<br/>
Fly o’re the backside of the World farr off<br/>
Into a <i>Limbo</i> large and broad, since calld<br/>
The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown<br/>
Long after, now unpeopl’d, and untrod;<br/>
All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he pass’d,<br/>
And long he wanderd, till at last a gleame<br/>
Of dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste<br/>
His travell’d steps; farr distant hee descries<br/>
Ascending by degrees magnificent<br/>
Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high,<br/>
At top whereof, but farr more rich appeerd<br/>
The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate<br/>
With Frontispice of Diamond and Gold<br/>
Imbellisht, thick with sparkling orient Gemmes<br/>
The Portal shon, inimitable on Earth<br/>
By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn.<br/>
The Stairs were such as whereon <i>Jacob</i> saw<br/>
Angels ascending and descending, bands<br/>
Of Guardians bright, when he from <i>Esau</i> fled<br/>
To <i>Padan-Aram</i> in the field of <i>Luz</i>,<br/>
Dreaming by night under the open Skie,<br/>
And waking cri’d, This is the Gate of Heav’n.<br/>
Each Stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood<br/>
There alwaies, but drawn up to Heav’n somtimes<br/>
Viewless, and underneath a bright Sea flow’d<br/>
Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearle, whereon<br/>
Who after came from Earth, sayling arriv’d,<br/>
Wafted by Angels, or flew o’re the Lake<br/>
Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds.<br/>
The Stairs were then let down, whether to dare<br/>
The Fiend by easie ascent, or aggravate<br/>
His sad exclusion from the dores of Bliss.<br/>
Direct against which op’nd from beneath,<br/>
Just o’re the blissful seat of Paradise,<br/>
A passage down to th’ Earth, a passage wide,<br/>
Wider by farr then that of after-times<br/>
Over Mount <i>Sion</i>, and, though that were large,<br/>
Over the <i>Promis’d Land</i> to God so dear,<br/>
By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes,<br/>
On high behests his Angels to and fro<br/>
Pass’d frequent, and his eye with choice regard<br/>
From <i>Paneas</i> the fount of <i>Jordans</i> flood<br/>
To <i>Beersaba</i>, where the <i>Holy Land</i><br/>
Borders on <i>Aegypt</i> and the <i>Arabian</i> shoare;<br/>
So wide the op’ning seemd, where bounds were set<br/>
To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave.<br/>
<i>Satan</i> from hence now on the lower stair<br/>
That scal’d by steps of Gold to Heav’n Gate<br/>
Looks down with wonder at the sudden view<br/>
Of all this World at once.  As when a Scout<br/>
Through dark and desart wayes with peril gone<br/>
All night; at last by break of chearful dawne<br/>
Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill,<br/>
Which to his eye discovers unaware<br/>
The goodly prospect of some forein land<br/>
First-seen, or some renownd Metropolis<br/>
With glistering Spires and Pinnacles adornd,<br/>
Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams.<br/>
Such wonder seis’d, though after Heaven seen,<br/>
The Spirit maligne, but much more envy seis’d<br/>
At sight of all this World beheld so faire.<br/>
Round he surveys, and well might, where he stood<br/>
So high above the circling Canopie<br/>
Of Nights extended shade; from Eastern Point<br/>
Of <i>Libra</i> to the fleecie Starr that bears<br/>
<i>Andromeda</i> farr off <i>Atlantick</i> Seas<br/>
Beyond th’ <i>Horizon</i>; then from Pole to Pole<br/>
He views in bredth, and without longer pause<br/>
Down right into the Worlds first Region throws<br/>
His flight precipitant, and windes with ease<br/>
Through the pure marble Air his oblique way<br/>
Amongst innumerable Starrs, that shon<br/>
Stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other Worlds,<br/>
Or other Worlds they seemd, or happy Iles,<br/>
Like those <i>Hesperian</i> Gardens fam’d of old,<br/>
Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flourie Vales,<br/>
Thrice happy Iles, but who dwelt happy there<br/>
He stayd not to enquire: above them all<br/>
The golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven<br/>
Allur’d his eye: Thither his course he bends<br/>
Through the calm Firmament; but up or downe<br/>
By center, or eccentric, hard to tell,<br/>
Or Longitude, where the great Luminarie<br/>
Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick,<br/>
That from his Lordly eye keep distance due,<br/>
Dispenses Light from farr; they as they move<br/>
Thir Starry dance in numbers that compute<br/>
Days, months, and years, towards his all-chearing Lamp<br/>
Turn swift their various motions, or are turnd<br/>
By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms<br/>
The Univers, and to each inward part<br/>
With gentle penetration, though unseen,<br/>
Shoots invisible vertue even to the deep:<br/>
So wondrously was set his Station bright.<br/>
There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps<br/>
Astronomer in the Sun’s lucent Orbe<br/>
Through his glaz’d Optic Tube yet never saw.<br/>
The place he found beyond expression bright,<br/>
Compar’d with aught on Earth, Medal or Stone;<br/>
Not all parts like, but all alike informd<br/>
With radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire;<br/>
If mettal, part seemd Gold, part Silver cleer;<br/>
If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite,<br/>
Rubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that shon<br/>
In <i>Aarons</i> Brest-plate, and a stone besides<br/>
Imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen,<br/>
That stone, or like to that which here below<br/>
Philosophers in vain so long have sought,<br/>
In vain, though by thir powerful Art they binde<br/>
Volatil <i>Hermes</i>, and call up unbound<br/>
In various shapes old <i>Proteus</i> from the Sea,<br/>
Draind through a Limbec to his Native forme.<br/>
What wonder then if fields and regions here<br/>
Breathe forth <i>Elixir</i> pure, and Rivers run<br/>
Potable Gold, when with one vertuous touch<br/>
Th’ Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us remote<br/>
Produces with Terrestrial Humor mixt<br/>
Here in the dark so many precious things<br/>
Of colour glorious and effect so rare?<br/>
Here matter new to gaze the Devil met<br/>
Undazl’d, farr and wide his eye commands,<br/>
For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade,<br/>
But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon<br/>
Culminate from th’ <i>Aequator</i>, as they now<br/>
Shot upward still direct, whence no way round<br/>
Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Aire,<br/>
No where so cleer, sharp’nd his visual ray<br/>
To objects distant farr, whereby he soon<br/>
Saw within kenn a glorious Angel stand,<br/>
The same whom <i>John</i> saw also in the Sun:<br/>
His back was turnd, but not his brightness hid;<br/>
Of beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiar<br/>
Circl’d his Head, nor less his Locks behind<br/>
Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings<br/>
Lay waving round; on som great charge imploy’d<br/>
Hee seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep.<br/>
Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope<br/>
To find who might direct his wandring flight<br/>
To Paradise the happie seat of Man,<br/>
His journies end and our beginning woe.<br/>
But first he casts to change his proper shape,<br/>
Which else might work him danger or delay:<br/>
And now a stripling Cherube he appeers,<br/>
Not of the prime, yet such as in his face<br/>
Youth smil’d Celestial, and to every Limb<br/>
Sutable grace diffus’d, so well he feignd;<br/>
Under a Coronet his flowing haire<br/>
In curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore<br/>
Of many a colourd plume sprinkl’d with Gold,<br/>
His habit fit for speed succinct, and held<br/>
Before his decent steps a Silver wand.<br/>
He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright,<br/>
Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd,<br/>
Admonisht by his eare, and strait was known<br/>
Th’ Arch-Angel <i>Uriel</i>, one of the seav’n<br/>
Who in Gods presence, neerest to his Throne<br/>
Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes<br/>
That run through all the Heav’ns, or down to th’ Earth<br/>
Bear his swift errands over moist and dry,<br/>
O’re Sea and Land: him <i>Satan</i> thus accostes;<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
<i>Uriel</i>, for thou of those seav’n Spirits that stand<br/>
In sight of God’s high Throne, gloriously bright,<br/>
The first art wont his great authentic will<br/>
Interpreter through highest Heav’n to bring,<br/>
Where all his Sons thy Embassie attend;<br/>
And here art likeliest by supream decree<br/>
Like honour to obtain, and as his Eye<br/>
To visit oft this new Creation round;<br/>
Unspeakable desire to see, and know<br/>
All these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man,<br/>
His chief delight and favour, him for whom<br/>
All these his works so wondrous he ordaind,<br/>
Hath brought me from the Quires of Cherubim<br/>
Alone thus wandring.  Brightest Seraph tell<br/>
In which of all these shining Orbes hath Man<br/>
His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none,<br/>
But all these shining Orbes his choice to dwell;<br/>
That I may find him, and with secret gaze,<br/>

On whom the great Creator hath bestowd<br/>
Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces powrd;<br/>
That both in him and all things, as is meet,<br/>
The Universal Maker we may praise;<br/>
Who justly hath drivn out his Rebell Foes<br/>
To deepest Hell, and to repair that loss<br/>
Created this new happie Race of Men<br/>
To serve him better: wise are all his wayes.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake the false dissembler unperceivd;<br/>
For neither Man nor Angel can discern<br/>
Hypocrisie, the only evil that walks<br/>
Invisible, except to God alone,<br/>
By his permissive will, through Heav’n and Earth:<br/>
And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps<br/>
At wisdoms Gate, and to simplicitie<br/>
Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill<br/>
Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguil’d<br/>
<i>Uriel</i>, though Regent of the Sun, and held<br/>
The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heav’n;<br/>
Who to the fraudulent Impostor foule<br/>
In his uprightness answer thus returnd.<br/>
Faire Angel, thy desire which tends to know<br/>
The works of God, thereby to glorifie<br/>
The great Work-Maister, leads to no excess<br/>
That reaches blame, but rather merits praise<br/>
The more it seems excess, that led thee hither<br/>
From thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone,<br/>
To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps<br/>
Contented with report heare onely in heav’n:<br/>
For wonderful indeed are all his works,<br/>
Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all<br/>
Had in remembrance alwayes with delight;<br/>
But what created mind can comprehend<br/>
Thir number, or the wisdom infinite<br/>
That brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep.<br/>
I saw when at his Word the formless Mass,<br/>
This worlds material mould, came to a heap:<br/>
Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar<br/>
Stood rul’d, stood vast infinitude confin’d;<br/>
Till at his second bidding darkness fled,<br/>
Light shon, and order from disorder sprung:<br/>
Swift to thir several Quarters hasted then<br/>
The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, Fire,<br/>
And this Ethereal quintessence of Heav’n<br/>
Flew upward, spirited with various forms,<br/>
That rowld orbicular, and turnd to Starrs<br/>
Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move;<br/>
Each had his place appointed, each his course,<br/>
The rest in circuit walles this Universe.<br/>
Look downward on that Globe whose hither side<br/>
With light from hence, though but reflected, shines;<br/>
That place is Earth the seat of Man, that light<br/>
His day, which else as th’ other Hemisphere<br/>
Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon<br/>
(So call that opposite fair Starr) her aide<br/>
Timely interposes, and her monthly round<br/>
Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heav’n;<br/>
With borrowd light her countenance triform<br/>
Hence fills and empties to enlighten th’ Earth,<br/>
And in her pale dominion checks the night.<br/>
That spot to which I point is <i>Paradise</i>,<br/>
<i>Adams</i> abode, those loftie shades his Bowre.<br/>
Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thus said, he turnd, and <i>Satan</i> bowing low,<br/>
As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven,<br/>
Where honour due and reverence none neglects,<br/>
Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath,<br/>
Down from th’ Ecliptic, sped with hop’d success,<br/>
Throws his steep flight with many an Aerie wheele,<br/>
Nor staid, till on <i>Niphates</i> top he lights.<br/>

<h3>  BOOK IV.</h3>
<p class="pfirst">
<span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span> For that warning voice, which he who saw<br/>
Th’ <i>Apocalyps</i>, heard cry in Heaven aloud,<br/>
Then when the Dragon, put to second rout,<br/>
Came furious down to be reveng’d on men,<br/>
<i>Wo to the Inhabitants on Earth!</i> that now,<br/>
While time was, our first Parents had bin warnd<br/>
The coming of thir secret foe, and scap’d<br/>
Haply so scap’d his mortal snare; for now<br/>
<i>Satan</i>, now first inflam’d with rage, came down,<br/>
The Tempter ere th’ Accuser of man-kind,<br/>
To wreck on innocent frail man his loss<br/>
Of that first Battel, and his flight to Hell:<br/>
Yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold,<br/>
Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast,<br/>
Begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth<br/>
Now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest,<br/>
And like a devillish Engine back recoiles<br/>
Upon himself; horror and doubt distract<br/>
His troubl’d thoughts, and from the bottom stirr<br/>
The Hell within him, for within him Hell<br/>
He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell<br/>
One step no more then from himself can fly<br/>
By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair<br/>
That slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie<br/>
Of what he was, what is, and what must be<br/>
Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue.<br/>
Sometimes towards <i>Eden</i> which now in his view<br/>
Lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad,<br/>
Sometimes towards Heav’n and the full-blazing Sun,<br/>
Which now sat high in his Meridian Towre:<br/>
Then much revolving, thus in sighs began.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O thou that with surpassing Glory crownd,<br/>
Look’st from thy sole Dominion like the God<br/>
Of this new World; at whose sight all the Starrs<br/>
Hide thir diminisht heads; to thee I call,<br/>
But with no friendly voice, and add thy name<br/>
O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams<br/>
That bring to my remembrance from what state<br/>
I fell, how glorious once above thy Spheare;<br/>
Till Pride and worse Ambition threw me down<br/>
Warring in Heav’n against Heav’ns matchless King:<br/>
Ah wherefore! he deservd no such return<br/>
From me, whom he created what I was<br/>
In that bright eminence, and with his good<br/>
Upbraided none; nor was his service hard.<br/>
What could be less then to afford him praise,<br/>
The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks,<br/>
How due! yet all his good prov’d ill in me,<br/>
And wrought but malice; lifted up so high<br/>
I sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher<br/>
Would set me highest, and in a moment quit<br/>
The debt immense of endless gratitude,<br/>
So burthensome, still paying, still to ow;<br/>
Forgetful what from him I still receivd,<br/>
And understood not that a grateful mind<br/>
By owing owes not, but still pays, at once<br/>
Indebted and dischargd; what burden then?<br/>
O had his powerful Destiny ordaind<br/>
Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood<br/>
Then happie; no unbounded hope had rais’d<br/>
Ambition.  Yet why not? som other Power<br/>
As great might have aspir’d, and me though mean<br/>
Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great<br/>
Fell not, but stand unshak’n, from within<br/>
Or from without, to all temptations arm’d.<br/>
Hadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand?<br/>
Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse,<br/>
But Heav’ns free Love dealt equally to all?<br/>
Be then his Love accurst, since love or hate,<br/>
To me alike, it deals eternal woe.<br/>
Nay curs’d be thou; since against his thy will<br/>
Chose freely what it now so justly rues.<br/>
Me miserable! which way shall I flie<br/>
Infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire?<br/>
Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell;<br/>
And in the lowest deep a lower deep<br/>
Still threatning to devour me opens wide,<br/>
To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heav’n.<br/>
O then at last relent: is there no place<br/>
Left for Repentance, none for Pardon left?<br/>
None left but by submission; and that word<br/>
<i>Disdain</i> forbids me, and my dread of shame<br/>
Among the spirits beneath, whom I seduc’d<br/>
With other promises and other vaunts<br/>
Then to submit, boasting I could subdue<br/>
Th’ Omnipotent.  Ay me, they little know<br/>
How dearly I abide that boast so vaine,<br/>
Under what torments inwardly I groane;<br/>
While they adore me on the Throne of Hell,<br/>
With Diadem and Scepter high advanc’d<br/>
The lower still I fall, onely Supream<br/>
In miserie; such joy Ambition findes.<br/>
But say I could repent and could obtaine<br/>
By Act of Grace my former state; how soon<br/>
Would highth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay<br/>
What feign’d submission swore: ease would recant<br/>
Vows made in pain, as violent and void.<br/>
For never can true reconcilement grow<br/>
Where wounds of deadly hate have peirc’d so deep:<br/>
Which would but lead me to a worse relapse<br/>
And heavier fall: so should I purchase deare<br/>
Short intermission bought with double smart.<br/>
This knows my punisher; therefore as farr<br/>
From granting hee, as I from begging peace:<br/>
All hope excluded thus, behold in stead<br/>
Of us out-cast, exil’d, his new delight,<br/>
Mankind created, and for him this World.<br/>
So farwel Hope, and with Hope farwel Fear,<br/>
Farwel Remorse: all Good to me is lost;<br/>
Evil be thou my Good; by thee at least<br/>
Divided Empire with Heav’ns King I hold<br/>
By thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne;<br/>
As Man ere long, and this new World shall know.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thus while he spake, each passion dimm’d his face<br/>
Thrice chang’d with pale, ire, envie and despair,<br/>
Which marrd his borrow’d visage, and betraid<br/>
Him counterfet, if any eye beheld.<br/>
For heav’nly mindes from such distempers foule<br/>
Are ever cleer.  Whereof hee soon aware,<br/>
Each perturbation smooth’d with outward calme,<br/>
Artificer of fraud; and was the first<br/>
That practisd falshood under saintly shew,<br/>
Deep malice to conceale, couch’t with revenge:<br/>
Yet not anough had practisd to deceive<br/>
<i>Uriel</i> once warnd; whose eye pursu’d him down<br/>
The way he went, and on th’ <i>Assyrian</i> mount<br/>
Saw him disfigur’d, more then could befall<br/>
Spirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce<br/>
He markd and mad demeanour, then alone,<br/>
As he suppos’d, all unobserv’d, unseen.<br/>
So on he fares, and to the border comes<br/>
Of <i>Eden</i>, where delicious Paradise,<br/>
Now nearer, Crowns with her enclosure green,<br/>
As with a rural mound the champain head<br/>
Of a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides<br/>
With thicket overgrown, grottesque and wilde,<br/>
Access deni’d; and over head up grew<br/>
Insuperable highth of loftiest shade,<br/>
Cedar, and Pine, and Firr, and branching Palm,<br/>
A Silvan Scene, and as the ranks ascend<br/>
Shade above shade, a woodie Theatre<br/>
Of stateliest view.  Yet higher then thir tops<br/>
The verdurous wall of Paradise up sprung:<br/>
Which to our general Sire gave prospect large<br/>
Into his neather Empire neighbouring round.<br/>
And higher then that Wall a circling row<br/>
Of goodliest Trees loaden with fairest Fruit,<br/>
Blossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue<br/>
Appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt:<br/>
On which the Sun more glad impress’d his beams<br/>
Then in fair Evening Cloud, or humid Bow,<br/>
When God hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd<br/>
That Lantskip: And of pure now purer aire<br/>
Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires<br/>
Vernal delight and joy, able to drive<br/>
All sadness but despair: now gentle gales<br/>
Fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense<br/>
Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole<br/>
Those balmie spoiles.  As when to them who saile<br/>
Beyond the <i>Cape of Hope</i>, and now are past<br/>
<i>Mozambic</i>, off at Sea North-East windes blow<br/>
<i>Sabean</i> Odours from the spicie shoare<br/>
Of <i>Arabie</i> the blest, with such delay<br/>
Well pleas’d they slack thir course, and many a League<br/>
Cheard with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles.<br/>
So entertaind those odorous sweets the Fiend<br/>
Who came thir bane, though with them better pleas’d<br/>
Then <i>Asmodeus</i> with the fishie fume,<br/>
That drove him, though enamourd, from the Spouse<br/>
Of <i>Tobits</i> Son, and with a vengeance sent<br/>
From <i>Media</i> post to <i>Aegypt</i>, there fast bound.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Now to th’ ascent of that steep savage Hill<br/>
<i>Satan</i> had journied on, pensive and slow;<br/>
But further way found none, so thick entwin’d,<br/>
As one continu’d brake, the undergrowth<br/>
Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext<br/>
All path of Man or Beast that past that way:<br/>
One Gate there onely was, and that look’d East<br/>
On th’ other side: which when th’ arch-fellon saw<br/>
Due entrance he disdaind, and in contempt,<br/>
At one slight bound high overleap’d all bound<br/>
Of Hill or highest Wall, and sheer within<br/>
Lights on his feet.  As when a prowling Wolfe,<br/>
Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey,<br/>
Watching where Shepherds pen thir Flocks at eeve<br/>
In hurdl’d Cotes amid the field secure,<br/>
Leaps o’re the fence with ease into the Fould:<br/>
Or as a Thief bent to unhoord the cash<br/>
Of some rich Burgher, whose substantial dores,<br/>
Cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault,<br/>
In at the window climbes, or o’re the tiles;<br/>
So clomb this first grand Thief into Gods Fould:<br/>
So since into his Church lewd Hirelings climbe.<br/>
Thence up he flew, and on the Tree of Life,<br/>
The middle Tree and highest there that grew,<br/>
Sat like a Cormorant; yet not true Life<br/>
Thereby regaind, but sat devising Death<br/>
To them who liv’d; nor on the vertue thought<br/>
Of that life-giving Plant, but only us’d<br/>
For prospect, what well us’d had bin the pledge<br/>
Of immortalitie.  So little knows<br/>
Any, but God alone, to value right<br/>
The good before him, but perverts best things<br/>
To worst abuse, or to thir meanest use.<br/>
Beneath him with new wonder now he views<br/>
To all delight of human sense expos’d<br/>
In narrow room Natures whole wealth, yea more,<br/>
A Heaven on Earth, for blissful Paradise<br/>
Of God the Garden was, by him in the East<br/>
Of <i>Eden</i> planted; <i>Eden</i> stretchd her Line<br/>
From <i>Auran</i> Eastward to the Royal Towrs<br/>
Of great <i>Seleucia</i>, built by <i>Grecian</i> Kings,<br/>
Or where the Sons of <i>Eden</i> long before<br/>
Dwelt in <i>Telassar:</i> in this pleasant soile<br/>
His farr more pleasant Garden God ordaind;<br/>
Out of the fertil ground he caus’d to grow<br/>
All Trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste;<br/>
And all amid them stood the Tree of Life,<br/>
High eminent, blooming Ambrosial Fruit<br/>
Of vegetable Gold; and next to Life<br/>
Our Death the Tree of Knowledge grew fast by,<br/>
Knowledge of Good bought dear by knowing ill.<br/>
Southward through <i>Eden</i> went a River large,<br/>
Nor chang’d his course, but through the shaggie hill<br/>
Pass’d underneath ingulft, for God had thrown<br/>
That Mountain as his Garden mould high rais’d<br/>
Upon the rapid current, which through veins<br/>
Of porous Earth with kindly thirst up drawn,<br/>
Rose a fresh Fountain, and with many a rill<br/>
Waterd the Garden; thence united fell<br/>
Down the steep glade, and met the neather Flood,<br/>
Which from his darksom passage now appeers,<br/>
And now divided into four main Streams,<br/>
Runs divers, wandring many a famous Realme<br/>
And Country whereof here needs no account,<br/>
But rather to tell how, if Art could tell,<br/>
How from that Saphire Fount the crisped Brooks,<br/>
Rowling on Orient Pearl and sands of Gold,<br/>
With mazie error under pendant shades<br/>
Ran Nectar, visiting each plant, and fed<br/>
Flours worthy of Paradise which not nice Art<br/>
In Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon<br/>
Powrd forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plaine,<br/>
Both where the morning Sun first warmly smote<br/>
The open field, and where the unpierc’t shade<br/>
Imbround the noontide Bowrs: Thus was this place,<br/>
A happy rural seat of various view;<br/>
Groves whose rich Trees wept odorous Gumms and Balme,<br/>
Others whose fruit burnisht with Golden Rinde<br/>
Hung amiable, <i>Hesperian</i> Fables true,<br/>
If true, here onely, and of delicious taste:<br/>
Betwixt them Lawns, or level Downs, and Flocks<br/>
Grasing the tender herb, were interpos’d,<br/>
Or palmie hilloc, or the flourie lap<br/>
Of som irriguous Valley spread her store,<br/>
Flours of all hue, and without Thorn the Rose:<br/>
Another side, umbrageous Grots and Caves<br/>
Of coole recess, o’re which the mantling Vine<br/>
Layes forth her purple Grape, and gently creeps<br/>
Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall<br/>
Down the slope hills, disperst, or in a Lake,<br/>
That to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crownd,<br/>
Her chrystall mirror holds, unite thir streams.<br/>
The Birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires,<br/>
Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune<br/>
The trembling leaves, while Universal <i>Pan</i><br/>
Knit with the <i>Graces</i> and the <i>Hours</i> in dance<br/>
Led on th’ Eternal Spring.  Not that faire field<br/>
Of <i>Enna</i>, where <i>Proserpin</i> gathring flours<br/>
Her self a fairer Floure by gloomie <i>Dis</i><br/>
Was gatherd, which cost <i>Ceres</i> all that pain<br/>
To seek her through the world; nor that sweet Grove<br/>
Of <i>Daphne</i> by <i>Orontes</i>, and th’ inspir’d<br/>
<i>Castalian</i> Spring might with this Paradise<br/>
Of <i>Eden</i> strive; nor that <i>Nyseian</i> Ile<br/>
Girt with the River <i>Triton</i>, where old <i>Cham</i>,<br/>
Whom Gentiles <i>Ammon</i> call and <i>Libyan Jove</i>,<br/>
Hid <i>Amalthea</i> and her Florid Son<br/>
Young <i>Bacchus</i> from his Stepdame <i>Rhea’s</i> eye;<br/>
Nor where <i>Abassin</i> Kings thir issue Guard,<br/>
Mount <i>Amara</i>, though this by som suppos’d<br/>
True Paradise under the <i>Ethiop</i> Line<br/>
By <i>Nilus</i> head, enclos’d with shining Rock,<br/>
A whole dayes journey high, but wide remote<br/>
From this <i>Assyrian</i> Garden, where the Fiend<br/>
Saw undelighted all delight, all kind<br/>
Of living Creatures new to sight and strange:<br/>
Two of far nobler shape erect and tall,<br/>
Godlike erect, with native Honour clad<br/>
In naked Majestie seemd Lords of all,<br/>
And worthie seemd, for in thir looks Divine<br/>
The image of thir glorious Maker shon,<br/>
Truth, Wisdome, Sanctitude severe and pure,<br/>
Severe, but in true filial freedom plac’t;<br/>
Whence true autoritie in men; though both<br/>
Not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd;<br/>
For contemplation hee and valour formd,<br/>
For softness shee and sweet attractive Grace,<br/>
Hee for God only, shee for God in him:<br/>
His fair large Front and Eye sublime declar’d<br/>
Absolute rule; and Hyacinthin Locks<br/>
Round from his parted forelock manly hung<br/>
Clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad:<br/>
Shee as a vail down to the slender waste<br/>
Her unadorned golden tresses wore<br/>
Dissheveld, but in wanton ringlets wav’d<br/>
As the Vine curles her tendrils, which impli’d<br/>
Subjection, but requir’d with gentle sway,<br/>
And by her yeilded, by him best receivd,<br/>
Yeilded with coy submission, modest pride,<br/>
And sweet reluctant amorous delay.<br/>
Nor those mysterious parts were then conceald,<br/>
Then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame<br/>
Of natures works, honor dishonorable,<br/>
Sin-bred, how have ye troubl’d all mankind<br/>
With shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure,<br/>
And banisht from mans life his happiest life,<br/>
Simplicitie and spotless innocence.<br/>
So passd they naked on, nor shund the sight<br/>
Of God or Angel, for they thought no ill:<br/>
So hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair<br/>
That ever since in loves imbraces met,<br/>
<i>Adam</i> the goodliest man of men since borne<br/>
His Sons, the fairest of her Daughters <i>Eve</i>.<br/>
Under a tuft of shade that on a green<br/>
Stood whispering soft, by a fresh Fountain side<br/>
They sat them down, and after no more toil<br/>
Of thir sweet Gardning labour then suffic’d<br/>
To recommend coole <i>Zephyr</i>, and made ease<br/>
More easie, wholsom thirst and appetite<br/>
More grateful, to thir Supper Fruits they fell,<br/>
Nectarine Fruits which the compliant boughes<br/>
Yeilded them, side-long as they sat recline<br/>
On the soft downie Bank damaskt with flours:<br/>
The savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde<br/>
Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream;<br/>
Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles<br/>
Wanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems<br/>
Fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial League,<br/>
Alone as they.  About them frisking playd<br/>
All Beasts of th’ Earth, since wilde, and of all chase<br/>
In Wood or Wilderness, Forrest or Den;<br/>
Sporting the Lion rampd, and in his paw<br/>
Dandl’d the Kid; Bears, Tygers, Ounces, Pards<br/>
Gambold before them, th’ unwieldy Elephant<br/>
To make them mirth us’d all his might, &amp; wreathd<br/>
His Lithe Proboscis; close the Serpent sly<br/>
Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine<br/>
His breaded train, and of his fatal guile<br/>
Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass<br/>
Coucht, and now fild with pasture gazing sat,<br/>
Or Bedward ruminating: for the Sun<br/>
Declin’d was hasting now with prone carreer<br/>
To th’ Ocean Iles, and in th’ ascending Scale<br/>
Of Heav’n the Starrs that usher Evening rose:<br/>
When <i>Satan</i> still in gaze, as first he stood,<br/>
Scarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad.<br/>

<p class="poem">
O Hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold,<br/>
Into our room of bliss thus high advanc’t<br/>
Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps,<br/>
Not Spirits, yet to heav’nly Spirits bright<br/>
Little inferior; whom my thoughts pursue<br/>
With wonder, and could love, so lively shines<br/>
In them Divine resemblance, and such grace<br/>
The hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd.<br/>
Ah gentle pair, yee little think how nigh<br/>
Your change approaches, when all these delights<br/>
Will vanish and deliver ye to woe,<br/>
More woe, the more your taste is now of joy;<br/>
Happie, but for so happie ill secur’d<br/>
Long to continue, and this high seat your Heav’n<br/>
Ill fenc’t for Heav’n to keep out such a foe<br/>
As now is enterd; yet no purpos’d foe<br/>
To you whom I could pittie thus forlorne<br/>
Though I unpittied: League with you I seek,<br/>
And mutual amitie so streight, so close,<br/>
That I with you must dwell, or you with me<br/>
Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please<br/>
Like this fair Paradise, your sense, yet such<br/>
Accept your Makers work; he gave it me,<br/>
Which I as freely give; Hell shall unfould,<br/>
To entertain you two, her widest Gates,<br/>
And send forth all her Kings; there will be room,<br/>
Not like these narrow limits, to receive<br/>
Your numerous ofspring; if no better place,<br/>
Thank him who puts me loath to this revenge<br/>
On you who wrong me not for him who wrongd.<br/>
And should I at your harmless innocence<br/>
Melt, as I doe, yet public reason just,<br/>
Honour and Empire with revenge enlarg’d,<br/>
By conquering this new World, compels me now<br/>
To do what else though damnd I should abhorre.<br/>

<p class="poem">
So spake the Fiend, and with necessitie,<br/>
The Tyrants plea, excus’d his devilish deeds.<br/>
Then from his loftie stand on that high Tree<br/>

Of those fourfooted kindes, himself now one,<br/>
Now other, as thir shape servd best his end<br/>
Neerer to view his prey, and unespi’d<br/>
To mark what of thir state he more might learn<br/>
By word or action markt: about them round<br/>
A Lion now he stalkes with fierie glare,<br/>
Then as a Tiger, who by chance hath spi’d<br/>
In some Purlieu two gentle Fawnes at play,<br/>
Strait couches close, then rising changes oft<br/>
His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground<br/>
Whence rushing he might surest seise them both<br/>

Sole partner and sole part of all these joyes,<br/>

Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound<br/>
Of waters issu’d from a Cave and spread<br/>
Into a liquid Plain, then stood unmov’d<br/>
Pure as th’ expanse of Heav’n; I thither went<br/>
With unexperienc’t thought, and laid me downe<br/>
On the green bank, to look into the cleer<br/>
Smooth Lake, that to me seemd another Skie.<br/>
As I bent down to look, just opposite,<br/>
A Shape within the watry gleam appeerd<br/>
Bending to look on me, I started back,<br/>
It started back, but pleasd I soon returnd,<br/>
Pleas’d it returnd as soon with answering looks<br/>
Of sympathie and love, there I had fixt<br/>
Mine eyes till now, and pin’d with vain desire,<br/>
Had not a voice thus warnd me, What thou seest,<br/>
What there thou seest fair Creature is thy self,<br/>
With thee it came and goes: but follow me,<br/>
And I will bring thee where no shadow staies<br/>
Thy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee<br/>
Whose image thou art, him thou shall enjoy<br/>
Inseparablie thine, to him shalt beare<br/>
Multitudes like thy self, and thence be call’d<br/>
Mother of human Race: what could I doe,<br/>
But follow strait, invisibly thus led?<br/>
Till I espi’d thee, fair indeed and tall,<br/>
Under a Platan, yet methought less faire,<br/>
Less winning soft, less amiablie milde,<br/>
Then that smooth watry image; back I turnd,<br/>
Thou following cryd’st aloud, Return fair <i>Eve</i>,<br/>
Whom fli’st thou? whom thou fli’st, of him thou art,<br/>
His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent<br/>
Out of my side to thee, neerest my heart<br/>
Substantial Life, to have thee by my side<br/>
Henceforth an individual solace dear;<br/>
Part of my Soul I seek thee, and thee claim<br/>
My other half: with that thy gentle hand<br/>
Seisd mine, I yeilded, and from that time see<br/>
How beauty is excelld by manly grace<br/>
And wisdom, which alone is truly fair.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake our general Mother, and with eyes<br/>
Of conjugal attraction unreprov’d,<br/>
And meek surrender, half imbracing leand<br/>
On our first Father, half her swelling Breast<br/>
Naked met his under the flowing Gold<br/>
Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight<br/>
Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms<br/>
Smil’d with superior Love, as <i>Jupiter</i><br/>
On <i>Juno</i> smiles, when he impregns the Clouds<br/>
That shed <i>May</i> Flowers; and press’d her Matron lip<br/>
With kisses pure: aside the Devil turnd<br/>
For envie, yet with jealous leer maligne<br/>
Ey’d them askance, and to himself thus plaind.<br/>

<p class="poem">
Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two<br/>
Imparadis’t in one anothers arms<br/>
The happier <i>Eden</i>, shall enjoy thir fill<br/>
Of bliss on bliss, while I to Hell am thrust,<br/>
Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire,<br/>
Among our other torments not the least,<br/>
Still unfulfill’d with pain of longing pines;<br/>
Yet let me not forget what I have gain’d<br/>
From thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems:<br/>
One fatal Tree there stands of Knowledge call’d,<br/>
Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidd’n?<br/>
Suspicious, reasonless.  Why should thir Lord<br/>
Envie them that? can it be sin to know,<br/>
Can it be death? and do they onely stand<br/>
By Ignorance, is that thir happie state,<br/>
The proof of thir obedience and thir faith?<br/>
O fair foundation laid whereon to build<br/>
Thir ruine!  Hence I will excite thir minds<br/>
With more desire to know, and to reject<br/>
Envious commands, invented with designe<br/>
To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt<br/>
Equal with Gods; aspiring to be such,<br/>
They taste and die: what likelier can ensue?<br/>
But first with narrow search I must walk round<br/>
This Garden, and no corner leave unspi’d;<br/>
A chance but chance may lead where I may meet<br/>
Some wandring Spirit of Heav’n, by Fountain side,<br/>
Or in thick shade retir’d, from him to draw<br/>
What further would be learnt.  Live while ye may,<br/>
Yet happie pair; enjoy, till I return,<br/>
Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed.<br/>

<p class="poem">
So saying, his proud step he scornful turn’d,<br/>
But with sly circumspection, and began<br/>
Through wood, through waste, o’re hil, o’re dale his roam.<br/>
Mean while in utmost Longitude, where Heav’n<br/>
With Earth and Ocean meets, the setting Sun<br/>
Slowly descended, and with right aspect<br/>
Against the eastern Gate of Paradise<br/>
Leveld his eevning Rayes: it was a Rock<br/>
Of Alablaster, pil’d up to the Clouds,<br/>
Conspicuous farr, winding with one ascent<br/>
Accessible from Earth, one entrance high;<br/>
The rest was craggie cliff, that overhung<br/>
Still as it rose, impossible to climbe.<br/>
Betwixt these rockie Pillars <i>Gabriel</i> sat<br/>
Chief of th’ Angelic Guards, awaiting night;<br/>
About him exercis’d Heroic Games<br/>
Th’ unarmed Youth of Heav’n, but nigh at hand<br/>
Celestial Armourie, Shields, Helmes, and Speares<br/>
Hung high with Diamond flaming, and with Gold.<br/>
Thither came <i>Uriel</i>, gliding through the Eeven<br/>
On a Sun beam, swift as a shooting Starr<br/>
In <i>Autumn</i> thwarts the night, when vapors fir’d<br/>
Impress the Air, and shews the Mariner<br/>
From what point of his Compass to beware<br/>
Impetuous winds: he thus began in haste.<br/>

A Spirit, zealous, as he seem’d, to know<br/>
More of th’ Almighties works, and chiefly Man<br/>
Gods latest Image: I describ’d his way<br/>
Bent all on speed, and markt his Aerie Gate;<br/>
But in the Mount that lies from <i>Eden</i> North,<br/>
Where he first lighted, soon discernd his looks<br/>
Alien from Heav’n, with passions foul obscur’d:<br/>
Mine eye pursu’d him still, but under shade<br/>
Lost sight of him; one of the banisht crew<br/>
I fear, hath ventur’d from the deep, to raise<br/>
New troubles; him thy care must be to find.<br/>

Well known from Heav’n; and since Meridian hour<br/>
No Creature thence: if Spirit of other sort,<br/>
So minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds<br/>
On purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude<br/>
Spiritual substance with corporeal barr.<br/>
But if within the circuit of these walks<br/>

Incredible how swift, had thither rowl’d<br/>
Diurnal, or this less volubil Earth<br/>
By shorter flight to th’ East, had left him there<br/>
Arraying with reflected Purple and Gold<br/>
The Clouds that on his Western Throne attend:<br/>
Now came still Eevning on, and Twilight gray<br/>
Had in her sober Liverie all things clad;<br/>
Silence accompanied, for Beast and Bird,<br/>

Were slunk, all but the wakeful Nightingale;<br/>
She all night long her amorous descant sung;<br/>
Silence was pleas’d: now glow’d the Firmament<br/>
With living Saphirs: <i>Hesperus</i> that led<br/>

Successive, and the timely dew of sleep<br/>
Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines<br/>
Our eye-lids; other Creatures all day long<br/>
Rove idle unimploid, and less need rest;<br/>

Appointed, which declares his Dignitie,<br/>
And the regard of Heav’n on all his waies;<br/>
While other Animals unactive range,<br/>
And of thir doings God takes no account.<br/>
Tomorrow ere fresh Morning streak the East<br/>
With first approach of light, we must be ris’n,<br/>
And at our pleasant labour, to reform<br/>
Yon flourie Arbors, yonder Allies green,<br/>
Our walks at noon, with branches overgrown,<br/>
That mock our scant manuring, and require<br/>
More hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth:<br/>
Those Blossoms also, and those dropping Gumms,<br/>

With thee conversing I forget all time,<br/>

After soft showers; and sweet the coming on<br/>

Millions of spiritual Creatures walk the Earth<br/>
Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:<br/>
All these with ceasless praise his works behold<br/>
Both day and night: how often from the steep<br/>
Of echoing Hill or Thicket have we heard<br/>
Celestial voices to the midnight air,<br/>

Singing thir great Creator: oft in bands<br/>
While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk<br/>

Thus talking hand in hand alone they pass’d<br/>
On to thir blissful Bower; it was a place<br/>
Chos’n by the sovran Planter, when he fram’d<br/>
All things to mans delightful use; the roofe<br/>
Of thickest covert was inwoven shade<br/>
Laurel and Mirtle, and what higher grew<br/>
Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side<br/>
<i>Acanthus</i>, and each odorous bushie shrub<br/>
Fenc’d up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour,<br/>
<i>Iris</i> all hues, Roses, and Gessamin<br/>
Rear’d high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought<br/>
Mosaic; underfoot the Violet,<br/>
Crocus, and Hyacinth with rich inlay<br/>
Broiderd the ground, more colour’d then with stone<br/>
Of costliest Emblem: other Creature here<br/>
Beast, Bird, Insect, or Worm durst enter none;<br/>
Such was thir awe of man.  In shadier Bower<br/>
More sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd,<br/>
<i>Pan</i> or <i>Silvanus</i> never slept, nor Nymph,<br/>
Nor <i>Faunus</i> haunted.  Here in close recess<br/>
With Flowers, Garlands, and sweet-smelling Herbs<br/>
Espoused <i>Eve</i> deckt first her Nuptial Bed,<br/>
And heav’nly Quires the Hymenaean sung,<br/>
What day the genial Angel to our Sire<br/>
Brought her in naked beauty more adorn’d,<br/>
More lovely then <i>Pandora</i>, whom the Gods<br/>
Endowd with all thir gifts, and O too like<br/>
In sad event, when to the unwiser Son<br/>
Of <i>Japhet</i> brought by <i>Hermes</i>, she ensnar’d<br/>

And starrie Pole: Thou also mad’st the Night,<br/>
Maker Omnipotent, and thou the Day,<br/>
Which we in our appointed work imployd<br/>
Have finisht happie in our mutual help<br/>
And mutual love, the Crown of all our bliss<br/>
Ordain’d by thee, and this delicious place<br/>
For us too large, where thy abundance wants<br/>

But thou hast promis’d from us two a Race<br/>

Among the bestial herds to raunge, by thee<br/>
Founded in Reason, Loyal, Just, and Pure,<br/>

Perpetual Fountain of Domestic sweets,<br/>

Present, or past, as Saints and Patriarchs us’d.<br/>
Here Love his golden shafts imploies, here lights<br/>
His constant Lamp, and waves his purple wings,<br/>
Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile<br/>
Of Harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard,<br/>
Casual fruition, nor in Court Amours<br/>
Mixt Dance, or wanton Mask, or Midnight Bal,<br/>
Or Serenate, which the starv’d Lover sings<br/>
To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain.<br/>

Such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring.<br/>

So saying, on he led his radiant Files,<br/>
Daz’ling the Moon; these to the Bower direct<br/>
In search of whom they sought: him there they found<br/>
Squat like a Toad, close at the eare of <i>Eve</i>;<br/>
Assaying by his Devilish art to reach<br/>
The Organs of her Fancie, and with them forge<br/>
Illusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams,<br/>
Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint<br/>
Th’ animal Spirits that from pure blood arise<br/>
Like gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raise<br/>
At least distemperd, discontented thoughts,<br/>
Vain hopes, vain aimes, inordinate desires<br/>
Blown up with high conceits ingendring pride.<br/>
Him thus intent <i>Ithuriel</i> with his Spear<br/>
Touch’d lightly; for no falshood can endure<br/>
Touch of Celestial temper, but returns<br/>
Of force to its own likeness: up he starts<br/>
Discoverd and surpriz’d.  As when a spark<br/>
Lights on a heap of nitrous Powder, laid<br/>
Fit for the Tun som Magazin to store<br/>
Against a rumord Warr, the Smuttie graine<br/>
With sudden blaze diffus’d, inflames the Aire:<br/>
So started up in his own shape the Fiend.<br/>

So sudden to behold the grieslie King;<br/>

Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same,<br/>
Or undiminisht brightness, to be known<br/>
As when thou stoodst in Heav’n upright and pure;<br/>
That Glorie then, when thou no more wast good,<br/>
Departed from thee, and thou resembl’st now<br/>

His lustre visibly impar’d; yet seemd<br/>
Undaunted.  If I must contend, said he,<br/>
Best with the best, the Sender not the sent,<br/>
Or all at once; more glorie will be wonn,<br/>
Or less be lost.  Thy fear, said <i>Zephon</i> bold,<br/>
Will save us trial what the least can doe<br/>
Single against thee wicked, and thence weak.<br/>

The Fiend repli’d not, overcome with rage;<br/>
But like a proud Steed reind, went hautie on,<br/>

His heart, not else dismai’d.  Now drew they nigh<br/>
The western point, where those half-rounding guards<br/>
Just met, &amp; closing stood in squadron joind<br/>
Awaiting next command.  To whom thir Chief<br/>

O friends, I hear the tread of nimble feet<br/>
Hasting this way, and now by glimps discerne<br/>

And with them comes a third of Regal port,<br/>
But faded splendor wan; who by his gate<br/>
And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell,<br/>
Not likely to part hence without contest;<br/>
Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours.<br/>

He scarce had ended, when those two approachd<br/>
And brief related whom they brought, wher found,<br/>
How busied, in what form and posture coucht.<br/>

Why hast thou, <i>Satan</i>, broke the bounds prescrib’d<br/>
To thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge<br/>
Of others, who approve not to transgress<br/>
By thy example, but have power and right<br/>
To question thy bold entrance on this place;<br/>
Imploi’d it seems to violate sleep, and those<br/>
Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss?<br/>

To whom thus <i>Satan</i> with contemptuous brow.<br/>

Puts me in doubt.  Lives ther who loves his pain?<br/>
Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell,<br/>
Though thither doomd?  Thou wouldst thy self, no doubt,<br/>
And boldly venture to whatever place<br/>
Farthest from pain, where thou mightst hope to change<br/>
Torment with ease, &amp; soonest recompence<br/>
Dole with delight, which in this place I sought;<br/>
To thee no reason; who knowst only good,<br/>
But evil hast not tri’d: and wilt object<br/>
His will who bound us? let him surer barr<br/>
His Iron Gates, if he intends our stay<br/>
In that dark durance: thus much what was askt.<br/>
The rest is true, they found me where they say;<br/>
But that implies not violence or harme.<br/>

Thus hee in scorn.  The warlike Angel mov’d,<br/>
Disdainfully half smiling thus repli’d.<br/>

And now returns him from his prison scap’t,<br/>
Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise<br/>
Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither<br/>
Unlicenc’t from his bounds in Hell prescrib’d;<br/>
So wise he judges it to fly from pain<br/>
However, and to scape his punishment.<br/>
So judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth,<br/>
Which thou incurr’st by flying, meet thy flight<br/>
Seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell,<br/>
Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain<br/>
Can equal anger infinite provok’t.<br/>
But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee<br/>
Came not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them<br/>
Less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they<br/>
Less hardie to endure? courageous Chief,<br/>
The first in flight from pain, had’st thou alleg’d<br/>
To thy deserted host this cause of flight,<br/>
Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.<br/>

To which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern.<br/>
Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain,<br/>
Insulting Angel, well thou knowst I stood<br/>

And seconded thy else not dreaded Spear.<br/>
But still thy words at random, as before,<br/>
Argue thy inexperience what behooves<br/>

Better abode, and my afflicted Powers<br/>
To settle here on Earth, or in mid Aire;<br/>
Though for possession put to try once more<br/>
What thou and thy gay Legions dare against;<br/>

To dispossess him, and thy self to reigne?<br/>
But mark what I arreede thee now, avant;<br/>
Flie thither whence thou fledst: if from this houre<br/>
Within these hallowd limits thou appeer,<br/>
Back to th’ infernal pit I drag thee chaind,<br/>
And Seale thee so, as henceforth not to scorne<br/>
The facil gates of hell too slightly barrd.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So threatn’d hee, but <i>Satan</i> to no threats<br/>
Gave heed, but waxing more in rage repli’d.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Then when I am thy captive talk of chaines,<br/>
Proud limitarie Cherube, but ere then<br/>
Farr heavier load thy self expect to feel<br/>
From my prevailing arme, though Heavens King<br/>
Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy Compeers,<br/>
Us’d to the yoak, draw’st his triumphant wheels<br/>
In progress through the rode of Heav’n Star-pav’d.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
While thus he spake, th’ Angelic Squadron bright<br/>
Turnd fierie red, sharpning in mooned hornes<br/>
Thir Phalanx, and began to hemm him round<br/>
With ported Spears, as thick as when a field<br/>
Of <i>Ceres</i> ripe for harvest waving bends<br/>
Her bearded Grove of ears, which way the wind<br/>
Swayes them; the careful Plowman doubting stands<br/>
Least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves<br/>
Prove chaff.  On th’ other side <i>Satan</i> allarm’d<br/>
Collecting all his might dilated stood,<br/>
Like <i>Teneriff</i> or <i>Atlas</i> unremov’d:<br/>
His stature reacht the Skie, and on his Crest<br/>
Sat horror Plum’d; nor wanted in his graspe<br/>
What seemd both Spear and Shield: now dreadful deeds<br/>
Might have ensu’d, nor onely Paradise<br/>
In this commotion, but the Starrie Cope<br/>
Of Heav’n perhaps, or all the Elements<br/>
At least had gon to rack, disturbd and torne<br/>
With violence of this conflict, had not soon<br/>
Th’ Eternal to prevent such horrid fray<br/>
Hung forth in Heav’n his golden Scales, yet seen<br/>
Betwixt <i>Astrea</i> and the <i>Scorpion</i> signe,<br/>
Wherein all things created first he weighd,<br/>
The pendulous round Earth with ballanc’t Aire<br/>
In counterpoise, now ponders all events,<br/>
Battels and Realms: in these he put two weights<br/>
The sequel each of parting and of fight;<br/>
The latter quick up flew, and kickt the beam;<br/>
Which <i>Gabriel</i> spying, thus bespake the Fiend.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
<i>Satan</i>, I know thy strength, and thou knowst mine,<br/>
Neither our own but giv’n; what follie then<br/>
To boast what Arms can doe, since thine no more<br/>
Then Heav’n permits, nor mine, though doubld now<br/>
To trample thee as mire: for proof look up,<br/>
And read thy Lot in yon celestial Sign<br/>
Where thou art weigh’d, &amp; shown how light, how weak,<br/>
If thou resist.  The Fiend lookt up and knew<br/>
His mounted scale aloft: nor more; but fled<br/>
Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.<br/>

<h3>  BOOK V.</h3>
<p class="pfirst">
<span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>ow Morn her rosie steps in th’ Eastern Clime<br/>
Advancing, sow’d the Earth with Orient Pearle,<br/>
When <i>Adam</i> wak’t, so customd, for his sleep<br/>
Was Aerie light, from pure digestion bred,<br/>
And temperat vapors bland, which th’ only sound<br/>
Of leaves and fuming rills, <i>Aurora’s</i> fan,<br/>
Lightly dispers’d, and the shrill Matin Song<br/>
Of Birds on every bough; so much the more<br/>
His wonder was to find unwak’nd <i>Eve</i><br/>
With Tresses discompos’d, and glowing Cheek,<br/>
As through unquiet rest: he on his side<br/>
Leaning half-rais’d, with looks of cordial Love<br/>
Hung over her enamour’d, and beheld<br/>
Beautie, which whether waking or asleep,<br/>
Shot forth peculiar Graces; then with voice<br/>
Milde, as when <i>Zephyrus</i> on <i>Flora</i> breathes,<br/>
Her hand soft touching, whisperd thus.  Awake<br/>
My fairest, my espous’d, my latest found,<br/>
Heav’ns last best gift, my ever new delight,<br/>
Awake, the morning shines, and the fresh field<br/>
Calls us, we lose the prime, to mark how spring<br/>
Our tended Plants, how blows the Citron Grove,<br/>
What drops the Myrrhe, &amp; what the balmie Reed,<br/>
How Nature paints her colours, how the Bee<br/>
Sits on the Bloom extracting liquid sweet.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Such whispering wak’d her, but with startl’d eye<br/>
On <i>Adam</i>, whom imbracing, thus she spake.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O Sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,<br/>
My Glorie, my Perfection, glad I see<br/>
Thy face, and Morn return’d, for I this Night,<br/>
Such night till this I never pass’d, have dream’d,<br/>
If dream’d, not as I oft am wont, of thee,<br/>
Works of day pass’t, or morrows next designe,<br/>
But of offence and trouble, which my mind<br/>
Knew never till this irksom night; methought<br/>
Close at mine ear one call’d me forth to walk<br/>
With gentle voice, I thought it thine; it said,<br/>
Why sleepst thou <i>Eve</i>? now is the pleasant time,<br/>
The cool, the silent, save where silence yields<br/>
To the night-warbling Bird, that now awake<br/>
Tunes sweetest his love-labor’d song; now reignes<br/>
Full Orb’d the Moon, and with more pleasing light<br/>
Shadowie sets off the face of things; in vain,<br/>
If none regard; Heav’n wakes with all his eyes,<br/>
Whom to behold but thee, Natures desire,<br/>
In whose sight all things joy, with ravishment<br/>
Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze.<br/>
I rose as at thy call, but found thee not;<br/>
To find thee I directed then my walk;<br/>
And on, methought, alone I pass’d through ways<br/>
That brought me on a sudden to the Tree<br/>
Of interdicted Knowledge: fair it seem’d,<br/>
Much fairer to my Fancie then by day:<br/>
And as I wondring lookt, beside it stood<br/>
One shap’d &amp; wing’d like one of those from Heav’n<br/>
By us oft seen; his dewie locks distill’d<br/>
Ambrosia; on that Tree he also gaz’d;<br/>
And O fair Plant, said he, with fruit surcharg’d,<br/>
Deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet,<br/>
Nor God, nor Man; is Knowledge so despis’d?<br/>
Or envie, or what reserve forbids to taste?<br/>
Forbid who will, none shall from me withhold<br/>
Longer thy offerd good, why else set here?<br/>
This said he paus’d not, but with ventrous Arme<br/>
He pluckt, he tasted; mee damp horror chil’d<br/>
At such bold words voucht with a deed so bold:<br/>
But he thus overjoy’d, O Fruit Divine,<br/>
Sweet of thy self, but much more sweet thus cropt,<br/>
Forbidd’n here, it seems, as onely fit<br/>
For Gods, yet able to make Gods of Men:<br/>
And why not Gods of Men, since good, the more<br/>
Communicated, more abundant growes,<br/>
The Author not impair’d, but honourd more?<br/>
Here, happie Creature, fair Angelic <i>Eve</i>,<br/>
Partake thou also; happie though thou art,<br/>
Happier thou mayst be, worthier canst not be:<br/>
Taste this, and be henceforth among the Gods<br/>
Thy self a Goddess, not to Earth confind,<br/>
But somtimes in the Air, as wee, somtimes<br/>
Ascend to Heav’n, by merit thine, and see<br/>
What life the Gods live there, and such live thou.<br/>
So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,<br/>
Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part<br/>
Which he had pluckt; the pleasant savourie smell<br/>
So quick’nd appetite, that I, methought,<br/>
Could not but taste.  Forthwith up to the Clouds<br/>
With him I flew, and underneath beheld<br/>
The Earth outstretcht immense, a prospect wide<br/>
And various: wondring at my flight and change<br/>
To this high exaltation; suddenly<br/>
My Guide was gon, and I, me thought, sunk down,<br/>
And fell asleep; but O how glad I wak’d<br/>
To find this but a dream!  Thus <i>Eve</i> her Night<br/>
Related, and thus <i>Adam</i> answerd sad.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Best Image of my self and dearer half,<br/>
The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep<br/>
Affects me equally; nor can I like<br/>
This uncouth dream, of evil sprung I fear;<br/>
Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,<br/>
Created pure.  But know that in the Soule<br/>
Are many lesser Faculties that serve<br/>
Reason as chief; among these Fansie next<br/>
Her office holds; of all external things,<br/>
Which the five watchful Senses represent,<br/>
She forms Imaginations, Aerie shapes,<br/>
Which Reason joyning or disjoyning, frames<br/>
All what we affirm or what deny, and call<br/>
Our knowledge or opinion; then retires<br/>
Into her private Cell when Nature rests.<br/>
Oft in her absence mimic Fansie wakes<br/>
To imitate her; but misjoyning shapes,<br/>
Wilde work produces oft, and most in dreams,<br/>
Ill matching words and deeds long past or late.<br/>
Som such resemblances methinks I find<br/>
Of our last Eevnings talk, in this thy dream,<br/>
But with addition strange; yet be not sad.<br/>
Evil into the mind of God or Man<br/>
May come and go, so unapprov’d, and leave<br/>
No spot or blame behind: Which gives me hope<br/>
That what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream,<br/>
Waking thou never wilt consent to do.<br/>
Be not disheart’nd then, nor cloud those looks<br/>
That wont to be more chearful and serene<br/>
Then when fair Morning first smiles on the World,<br/>
And let us to our fresh imployments rise<br/>
Among the Groves, the Fountains, and the Flours<br/>
That open now thir choicest bosom’d smells<br/>
Reservd from night, and kept for thee in store.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So cheard he his fair Spouse, and she was cheard,<br/>
But silently a gentle tear let fall<br/>
From either eye, and wip’d them with her haire;<br/>
Two other precious drops that ready stood,<br/>
Each in thir chrystal sluce, hee ere they fell<br/>
Kiss’d as the gracious signs of sweet remorse<br/>
And pious awe, that feard to have offended.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So all was cleard, and to the Field they haste.<br/>
But first from under shadie arborous roof,<br/>
Soon as they forth were come to open sight<br/>
Of day-spring, and the Sun, who scarce up risen<br/>
With wheels yet hov’ring o’re the Ocean brim,<br/>
Shot paralel to the earth his dewie ray,<br/>
Discovering in wide Lantskip all the East<br/>
Of Paradise and <i>Edens</i> happie Plains,<br/>
Lowly they bow’d adoring, and began<br/>
Thir Orisons, each Morning duly paid<br/>
In various style, for neither various style<br/>
Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise<br/>
Thir Maker, in fit strains pronounc’t or sung<br/>
Unmeditated, such prompt eloquence<br/>
Flowd from thir lips, in Prose or numerous Verse,<br/>
More tuneable then needed Lute or Harp<br/>
To add more sweetness, and they thus began.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
These are thy glorious works, Parent of good,<br/>
Almightie, thine this universal Frame,<br/>
Thus wondrous fair; thy self how wondrous then!<br/>
Unspeakable, who sitst above these Heavens<br/>
To us invisible or dimly seen<br/>
In these thy lowest works, yet these declare<br/>
Thy goodness beyond thought, and Power Divine:<br/>
Speak yee who best can tell, ye Sons of light,<br/>
Angels, for yee behold him, and with songs<br/>
And choral symphonies, Day without Night,<br/>
Circle his Throne rejoycing, yee in Heav’n,<br/>
On Earth joyn all yee Creatures to extoll<br/>
Him first, him last, him midst, and without end.<br/>
Fairest of Starrs, last in the train of Night,<br/>
If better thou belong not to the dawn,<br/>
Sure pledge of day, that crownst the smiling Morn<br/>
With thy bright Circlet, praise him in thy Spheare<br/>
While day arises, that sweet hour of Prime.<br/>
Thou Sun, of this great World both Eye and Soule,<br/>
Acknowledge him thy Greater, sound his praise<br/>
In thy eternal course, both when thou climb’st,<br/>
And when high Noon hast gaind, &amp; when thou fallst.<br/>
Moon, that now meetst the orient Sun, now fli’st<br/>
With the fixt Starrs, fixt in thir Orb that flies,<br/>
And yee five other wandring Fires that move<br/>
In mystic Dance not without Song, resound<br/>
His praise, who out of Darkness call’d up Light.<br/>
Aire, and ye Elements the eldest birth<br/>
Of Natures Womb, that in quaternion run<br/>
Perpetual Circle, multiform; and mix<br/>
And nourish all things, let your ceasless change<br/>
Varie to our great Maker still new praise.<br/>
Ye Mists and Exhalations that now rise<br/>
From Hill or steaming Lake, duskie or grey,<br/>
Till the Sun paint your fleecie skirts with Gold,<br/>
In honour to the Worlds great Author rise,<br/>
Whether to deck with Clouds the uncolourd skie,<br/>
Or wet the thirstie Earth with falling showers,<br/>
Rising or falling still advance his praise.<br/>
His praise ye Winds, that from four Quarters blow,<br/>
Breath soft or loud; and wave your tops, ye Pines,<br/>
With every Plant, in sign of Worship wave.<br/>
Fountains and yee, that warble, as ye flow,<br/>
Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.<br/>
Joyn voices all ye living Souls, ye Birds,<br/>
That singing up to Heaven Gate ascend,<br/>
Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise;<br/>
Yee that in Waters glide, and yee that walk<br/>
The Earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;<br/>
Witness if I be silent, Morn or Eeven,<br/>
To Hill, or Valley, Fountain, or fresh shade<br/>
Made vocal by my Song, and taught his praise.<br/>
Hail universal Lord, be bounteous still<br/>
To give us onely good; and if the night<br/>
Have gathered aught of evil or conceald,<br/>
Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So pray’d they innocent, and to thir thoughts<br/>
Firm peace recoverd soon and wonted calm.<br/>
On to thir mornings rural work they haste<br/>
Among sweet dewes and flours; where any row<br/>
Of Fruit-trees overwoodie reachd too farr<br/>
Thir pamperd boughes, and needed hands to check<br/>
Fruitless imbraces: or they led the Vine<br/>
To wed her Elm; she spous’d about him twines<br/>
Her mariageable arms, and with her brings<br/>
Her dowr th’ adopted Clusters, to adorn<br/>
His barren leaves.  Them thus imploid beheld<br/>
With pittie Heav’ns high King, and to him call’d<br/>
<i>Raphael</i>, the sociable Spirit, that deign’d<br/>
To travel with <i>Tobias</i>, and secur’d<br/>
His marriage with the seaventimes-wedded Maid.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
<i>Raphael</i>, said hee, thou hear’st what stir on Earth<br/>
<i>Satan</i> from Hell scap’t through the darksom Gulf<br/>
Hath raisd in Paradise, and how disturbd<br/>
This night the human pair, how he designes<br/>
In them at once to ruin all mankind.<br/>
Go therefore, half this day as friend with friend<br/>
Converse with <i>Adam</i>, in what Bowre or shade<br/>
Thou find’st him from the heat of Noon retir’d,<br/>
To respit his day-labour with repast,<br/>
Or with repose; and such discourse bring on,<br/>
As may advise him of his happie state,<br/>
Happiness in his power left free to will,<br/>
Left to his own free Will, his Will though free,<br/>
Yet mutable; whence warne him to beware<br/>
He swerve not too secure: tell him withall<br/>
His danger, and from whom, what enemie<br/>
Late falln himself from Heav’n, is plotting now<br/>
The fall of others from like state of bliss;<br/>
By violence, no, for that shall be withstood,<br/>
But by deceit and lies; this let him know,<br/>
Least wilfully transgressing he pretend<br/>
Surprisal, unadmonisht, unforewarnd.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake th’ Eternal Father, and fulfilld<br/>
All Justice: nor delaid the winged Saint<br/>
After his charge receivd, but from among<br/>
Thousand Celestial Ardors, where he stood<br/>
Vaild with his gorgeous wings, up springing light<br/>
Flew through the midst of Heav’n; th’ angelic Quires<br/>
On each hand parting, to his speed gave way<br/>
Through all th’ Empyreal road; till at the Gate<br/>
Of Heav’n arriv’d, the gate self-opend wide<br/>
On golden Hinges turning, as by work<br/>
Divine the sov’ran Architect had fram’d.<br/>
From hence, no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,<br/>
Starr interpos’d, however small he sees,<br/>
Not unconform to other shining Globes,<br/>
Earth and the Gard’n of God, with Cedars crownd<br/>
Above all Hills.  As when by night the Glass<br/>
Of <i>Galileo</i>, less assur’d, observes<br/>
Imagind Lands and Regions in the Moon:<br/>
Or Pilot from amidst the <i>Cyclades</i><br/>
<i>Delos</i> or <i>Samos</i> first appeering kenns<br/>
A cloudy spot.  Down thither prone in flight<br/>
He speeds, and through the vast Ethereal Skie<br/>
Sailes between worlds &amp; worlds, with steddie wing<br/>
Now on the polar windes, then with quick Fann<br/>
Winnows the buxom Air; till within soare<br/>
Of Towring Eagles, to all the Fowles he seems<br/>
A <i>Phoenix</i>, gaz’d by all, as that sole Bird<br/>
When to enshrine his reliques in the Sun’s<br/>
Bright Temple, to <i>Aegyptian Theb’s</i> he flies.<br/>
At once on th’ Eastern cliff of Paradise<br/>
He lights, and to his proper shape returns<br/>
A Seraph wingd; six wings he wore, to shade<br/>
His lineaments Divine; the pair that clad<br/>
Each shoulder broad, came mantling o’re his brest<br/>
With regal Ornament; the middle pair<br/>
Girt like a Starrie Zone his waste, and round<br/>
Skirted his loines and thighes with downie Gold<br/>
And colours dipt in Heav’n; the third his feet<br/>
Shaddowd from either heele with featherd maile<br/>
Skie-tinctur’d grain.  Like <i>Maia’s</i> son he stood,<br/>
And shook his Plumes, that Heav’nly fragrance filld<br/>
The circuit wide.  Strait knew him all the bands<br/>
Of Angels under watch; and to his state,<br/>
And to his message high in honour rise;<br/>
For on som message high they guessd him bound.<br/>
Thir glittering Tents he passd, and now is come<br/>
Into the blissful field, through Groves of Myrrhe,<br/>
And flouring Odours, Cassia, Nard, and Balme;<br/>
A Wilderness of sweets; for Nature here<br/>
Wantond as in her prime, and plaid at will<br/>
Her Virgin Fancies, pouring forth more sweet,<br/>
Wilde above rule or art; enormous bliss.<br/>
Him through the spicie Forrest onward com<br/>
<i>Adam</i> discernd, as in the dore he sat<br/>
Of his coole Bowre, while now the mounted Sun<br/>
Shot down direct his fervid Raies, to warme<br/>
Earths inmost womb, more warmth then <i>Adam</i> need;<br/>
And <i>Eve</i> within, due at her hour prepar’d<br/>
For dinner savourie fruits, of taste to please<br/>
True appetite, and not disrelish thirst<br/>
Of nectarous draughts between, from milkie stream,<br/>
Berrie or Grape: to whom thus <i>Adam</i> call’d.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Haste hither <i>Eve</i>, and worth thy sight behold<br/>
Eastward among those Trees, what glorious shape<br/>
Comes this way moving; seems another Morn<br/>
Ris’n on mid-noon; som great behest from Heav’n<br/>
To us perhaps he brings, and will voutsafe<br/>
This day to be our Guest.  But goe with speed,<br/>
And what thy stores contain, bring forth and poure<br/>
Abundance, fit to honour and receive<br/>
Our Heav’nly stranger; well we may afford<br/>
Our givers thir own gifts, and large bestow<br/>
From large bestowd, where Nature multiplies<br/>
Her fertil growth, and by disburd’ning grows<br/>
More fruitful, which instructs us not to spare.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
To whom thus <i>Eve</i>. <i>Adam</i>, earths hallowd mould,<br/>
Of God inspir’d, small store will serve, where store,<br/>
All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;<br/>
Save what by frugal storing firmness gains<br/>
To nourish, and superfluous moist consumes:<br/>
But I will haste and from each bough and break,<br/>
Each Plant &amp; juciest Gourd will pluck such choice<br/>
To entertain our Angel guest, as hee<br/>
Beholding shall confess that here on Earth<br/>
God hath dispenst his bounties as in Heav’n.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So saying, with dispatchful looks in haste<br/>
She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent<br/>
What choice to chuse for delicacie best,<br/>
What order, so contriv’d as not to mix<br/>
Tastes, not well joynd, inelegant, but bring<br/>
Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change,<br/>
Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk<br/>
Whatever Earth all-bearing Mother yeilds<br/>
In <i>India</i> East or West, or middle shoare<br/>
In <i>Pontus</i> or the <i>Punic</i> Coast, or where<br/>
<i>Alcinous</i> reign’d, fruit of all kindes, in coate,<br/>
Rough, or smooth rin’d, or bearded husk, or shell<br/>
She gathers, Tribute large, and on the board<br/>
Heaps with unsparing hand; for drink the Grape<br/>
She crushes, inoffensive moust, and meathes<br/>
From many a berrie, and from sweet kernels prest<br/>
She tempers dulcet creams, nor these to hold<br/>
Wants her fit vessels pure, then strews the ground<br/>
With Rose and Odours from the shrub unfum’d.<br/>
Mean while our Primitive great Sire, to meet<br/>
His god-like Guest, walks forth, without more train<br/>
Accompani’d then with his own compleat<br/>
Perfections, in himself was all his state,<br/>
More solemn then the tedious pomp that waits<br/>
On Princes, when thir rich Retinue long<br/>
Of Horses led, and Grooms besmeard with Gold<br/>
Dazles the croud, and sets them all agape.<br/>
Neerer his presence <i>Adam</i> though not awd,<br/>
Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek,<br/>
As to a superior Nature, bowing low,<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thus said.  Native of Heav’n, for other place<br/>
None can then Heav’n such glorious shape contain;<br/>
Since by descending from the Thrones above,<br/>
Those happie places thou hast deignd a while<br/>
To want, and honour these, voutsafe with us<br/>
Two onely, who yet by sov’ran gift possess<br/>
This spacious ground, in yonder shadie Bowre<br/>
To rest, and what the Garden choicest bears<br/>
To sit and taste, till this meridian heat<br/>
Be over, and the Sun more coole decline.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Whom thus the Angelic Vertue answerd milde.<br/>
<i>Adam</i>, I therefore came, nor art thou such<br/>
Created, or such place hast here to dwell,<br/>
As may not oft invite, though Spirits of Heav’n<br/>
To visit thee; lead on then where thy Bowre<br/>
Oreshades; for these mid-hours, till Eevning rise<br/>
I have at will.  So to the Silvan Lodge<br/>
They came, that like <i>Pomona’s</i> Arbour smil’d<br/>
With flourets deck’t and fragrant smells; but <i>Eve</i><br/>
Undeckt, save with her self more lovely fair<br/>
Then Wood-Nymph, or the fairest Goddess feign’d<br/>
Of three that in Mount <i>Ida</i> naked strove,<br/>
Stood to entertain her guest from Heav’n; no vaile<br/>
Shee needed, Vertue-proof, no thought infirme<br/>
Alterd her cheek.  On whom the Angel <i>Haile</i><br/>
Bestowd, the holy salutation us’d<br/>
Long after to blest <i>Marie</i>, second <i>Eve</i>.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Haile Mother of Mankind, whose fruitful Womb<br/>
Shall fill the World more numerous with thy Sons<br/>
Then with these various fruits the Trees of God<br/>
Have heap’d this Table.  Rais’d of grassie terf<br/>
Thir Table was, and mossie seats had round,<br/>
And on her ample Square from side to side<br/>
All <i>Autumn</i> pil’d, though <i>Spring</i> and <i>Autumn</i> here<br/>
Danc’d hand in hand.  A while discourse they hold;<br/>
No fear lest Dinner coole; when thus began<br/>
Our Authour.  Heav’nly stranger, please to taste<br/>
These bounties which our Nourisher, from whom<br/>
All perfet good unmeasur’d out, descends,<br/>
To us for food and for delight hath caus’d<br/>
The Earth to yeild; unsavourie food perhaps<br/>
To spiritual Natures; only this I know,<br/>
That one Celestial Father gives to all.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
To whom the Angel.  Therefore what he gives<br/>
(Whose praise be ever sung) to man in part<br/>
Spiritual, may of purest Spirits be found<br/>
No ingrateful food: and food alike those pure<br/>
Intelligential substances require<br/>
As doth your Rational; and both contain<br/>
Within them every lower facultie<br/>
Of sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,<br/>
Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate,<br/>
And corporeal to incorporeal turn.<br/>
For know, whatever was created, needs<br/>
To be sustaind and fed; of Elements<br/>
The grosser feeds the purer, earth the sea,<br/>
Earth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those Fires<br/>
Ethereal, and as lowest first the Moon;<br/>
Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurg’d<br/>
Vapours not yet into her substance turnd.<br/>
Nor doth the Moon no nourishment exhale<br/>
From her moist Continent to higher Orbes.<br/>
The Sun that light imparts to all, receives<br/>
From all his alimental recompence<br/>
In humid exhalations, and at Even<br/>
Sups with the Ocean: though in Heav’n the Trees<br/>
Of life ambrosial frutage bear, and vines<br/>
Yeild Nectar, though from off the boughs each Morn<br/>
We brush mellifluous Dewes, and find the ground<br/>
Cover’d with pearly grain: yet God hath here<br/>
Varied his bounty so with new delights,<br/>
As may compare with Heaven; and to taste<br/>
Think not I shall be nice.  So down they sat,<br/>
And to thir viands fell, nor seemingly<br/>
The Angel, nor in mist, the common gloss<br/>
Of Theologians, but with keen dispatch<br/>
Of real hunger, and concoctive heate<br/>
To transubstantiate; what redounds, transpires<br/>
Through Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fire<br/>
Of sooty coal the Empiric Alchimist<br/>
Can turn, or holds it possible to turn<br/>
Metals of drossiest Ore to perfet Gold<br/>
As from the Mine.  Mean while at Table <i>Eve</i><br/>
Ministerd naked, and thir flowing cups<br/>
With pleasant liquors crown’d: O innocence<br/>
Deserving Paradise! if ever, then,<br/>
Then had the Sons of God excuse to have bin<br/>
Enamour’d at that sight; but in those hearts<br/>
Love unlibidinous reign’d, nor jealousie<br/>
Was understood, the injur’d Lovers Hell.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thus when with meats &amp; drinks they had suffic’d,<br/>
Not burd’nd Nature, sudden mind arose<br/>
In <i>Adam</i>, not to let th’ occasion pass<br/>
Given him by this great Conference to know<br/>
Of things above his World, and of thir being<br/>
Who dwell in Heav’n, whose excellence he saw<br/>
Transcend his own so farr, whose radiant forms<br/>
Divine effulgence, whose high Power so far<br/>
Exceeded human, and his wary speech<br/>
Thus to th’ Empyreal Minister he fram’d.<br/>

<p class="poem">
Inhabitant with God, now know I well<br/>
Thy favour, in this honour done to man,<br/>
Under whose lowly roof thou hast voutsaf’t<br/>
To enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,<br/>
Food not of Angels, yet accepted so,<br/>
As that more willingly thou couldst not seem<br/>
At Heav’ns high feasts to have fed: yet what compare?<br/>

<p class="poem">
 To whom the winged Hierarch repli’d.<br/>
O <i>Adam</i>, one Almightie is, from whom<br/>
All things proceed, and up to him return,<br/>
If not deprav’d from good, created all<br/>
Such to perfection, one first matter all,<br/>
Indu’d with various forms, various degrees<br/>
Of substance, and in things that live, of life;<br/>
But more refin’d, more spiritous, and pure,<br/>
As neerer to him plac’t or neerer tending<br/>
Each in thir several active Sphears assignd,<br/>
Till body up to spirit work, in bounds<br/>
Proportiond to each kind.  So from the root<br/>
Springs lighter the green stalk, from thence the leaves<br/>
More aerie, last the bright consummate floure<br/>
Spirits odorous breathes: flours and thir fruit<br/>
Mans nourishment, by gradual scale sublim’d<br/>
To vital Spirits aspire, to animal,<br/>
To intellectual, give both life and sense,<br/>
Fansie and understanding, whence the soule<br/>
Reason receives, and reason is her being,<br/>
Discursive, or Intuitive; discourse<br/>
Is oftest yours, the latter most is ours,<br/>
Differing but in degree, of kind the same.<br/>
Wonder not then, what God for you saw good<br/>
If I refuse not, but convert, as you,<br/>
To proper substance; time may come when men<br/>
With Angels may participate, and find<br/>
No inconvenient Diet, nor too light Fare:<br/>
And from these corporal nutriments perhaps<br/>
Your bodies may at last turn all to Spirit<br/>
Improv’d by tract of time, and wingd ascend<br/>
Ethereal, as wee, or may at choice<br/>
Here or in Heav’nly Paradises dwell;<br/>
If ye be found obedient, and retain<br/>
Unalterably firm his love entire<br/>
Whose progenie you are.  Mean while enjoy<br/>
Your fill what happiness this happie state<br/>
Can comprehend, incapable of more.<br/>

<p class="poem">
To whom the Patriarch of mankind repli’d.<br/>
O favourable spirit, propitious guest,<br/>
Well hast thou taught the way that might direct<br/>
Our knowledge, and the scale of Nature set<br/>
From center to circumference, whereon<br/>
In contemplation of created things<br/>
By steps we may ascend to God.  But say,<br/>
What meant that caution joind, <i>If ye be found<br/>
obedient?</i> can wee want obedience then<br/>
To him, or possibly his love desert<br/>
Who formd us from the dust, and plac’d us here<br/>
Full to the utmost measure of what bliss<br/>
Human desires can seek or apprehend?<br/>

This was that caution giv’n thee; be advis’d.<br/>
God made thee perfet, not immutable;<br/>
And good he made thee, but to persevere<br/>
He left it in thy power, ordaind thy will<br/>
By nature free, not over-rul’d by Fate<br/>
Inextricable, or strict necessity;<br/>
Our voluntarie service he requires,<br/>
Not our necessitated, such with him<br/>
Findes no acceptance, nor can find, for how<br/>
Can hearts, not free, be tri’d whether they serve<br/>
Willing or no, who will but what they must<br/>
By Destinie, and can no other choose?<br/>
My self and all th’ Angelic Host that stand<br/>
In sight of God enthron’d, our happie state<br/>
Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;<br/>
On other surety none; freely we serve.<br/>
Because wee freely love, as in our will<br/>
To love or not; in this we stand or fall:<br/>
And som are fall’n, to disobedience fall’n,<br/>

To whom our great Progenitor.  Thy words<br/>
Attentive, and with more delighted eare<br/>

Cherubic Songs by night from neighbouring Hills<br/>
Aereal Music send: nor knew I not<br/>
To be both will and deed created free;<br/>
Yet that we never shall forget to love<br/>
Our maker, and obey him whose command<br/>
Single, is yet so just, my constant thoughts<br/>
Assur’d me and still assure: though what thou tellst<br/>
Hath past in Heav’n, som doubt within me move,<br/>
But more desire to hear, if thou consent,<br/>
The full relation, which must needs be strange,<br/>
Worthy of Sacred silence to be heard;<br/>
And we have yet large day, for scarce the Sun<br/>
Hath finisht half his journey, and scarce begins<br/>
His other half in the great Zone of Heav’n.<br/>

To human sense th’ invisible exploits<br/>
Of warring Spirits; how without remorse<br/>
The ruin of so many glorious once<br/>
And perfet while they stood; how last unfould<br/>
The secrets of another world, perhaps<br/>
Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good<br/>
This is dispenc’t, and what surmounts the reach<br/>
Of human sense, I shall delineate so,<br/>
By lik’ning spiritual to corporal forms,<br/>
As may express them best, though what if Earth<br/>

<p class="poem">
As yet this world was not, and <i>Chaos</i> wilde<br/>

Upon her Center pois’d, when on a day<br/>

To motion, measures all things durable<br/>
By present, past, and future) on such day<br/>
As Heav’ns great Year brings forth, th’ Empyreal Host<br/>
Of Angels by Imperial summons call’d,<br/>
Innumerable before th’ Almighties Throne<br/>
Forthwith from all the ends of Heav’n appeerd<br/>
Under thir Hierarchs in orders bright<br/>
Ten thousand thousand Ensignes high advanc’d,<br/>
Standards, and Gonfalons twixt Van and Reare<br/>
Streame in the Aire, and for distinction serve<br/>
Of Hierarchies, of Orders, and Degrees;<br/>
Or in thir glittering Tissues bear imblaz’d<br/>
Holy Memorials, acts of Zeale and Love<br/>
Recorded eminent.  Thus when in Orbes<br/>
Of circuit inexpressible they stood,<br/>
Orb within Orb, the Father infinite,<br/>
By whom in bliss imbosom’d sat the Son,<br/>
Amidst as from a flaming Mount, whoseop<br/>

Hear all ye Angels, Progenie of Light,<br/>
Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,<br/>
Hear my Decree, which unrevok’t shall stand.<br/>
This day I have begot whom I declare<br/>
My onely Son, and on this holy Hill<br/>
Him have anointed, whom ye now behold<br/>
At my right hand; your Head I him appoint;<br/>
And by my Self have sworn to him shall bow<br/>
All knees in Heav’n, and shall confess him Lord:<br/>
Under his great Vice-gerent Reign abide<br/>
United as one individual Soule<br/>
For ever happie: him who disobeyes<br/>
Mee disobeyes, breaks union, and that day<br/>
Cast out from God and blessed vision, falls<br/>
Into utter darkness, deep ingulft, his place<br/>
Ordaind without redemption, without end.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake th’ Omnipotent, and with his words<br/>
All seemd well pleas’d, all seem’d, but were not all.<br/>
That day, as other solem dayes, they spent<br/>
In song and dance about the sacred Hill,<br/>
Mystical dance, which yonder starrie Spheare<br/>
Of Planets and of fixt in all her Wheeles<br/>
Resembles nearest, mazes intricate,<br/>
Eccentric, intervolv’d, yet regular<br/>
Then most, when most irregular they seem:<br/>
And in thir motions harmonie Divine<br/>
So smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear<br/>
Listens delighted.  Eevning approachd<br/>
(For we have also our Eevning and our Morn,<br/>
We ours for change delectable, not need)<br/>
Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn<br/>
Desirous, all in Circles as they stood,<br/>
Tables are set, and on a sudden pil’d<br/>
With Angels Food, and rubied Nectar flows:<br/>
In Pearl, in Diamond, and massie Gold,<br/>
Fruit of delicious Vines, the growth of Heav’n.<br/>
They eat, they drink, and with refection sweet<br/>
Are fill’d, before th’ all bounteous King, who showrd<br/>
With copious hand, rejoycing in thir joy.<br/>
Now when ambrosial Night with Clouds exhal’d<br/>
From that high mount of God, whence light &amp; shade<br/>
Spring both, the face of brightest Heav’n had changd<br/>
To grateful Twilight (for Night comes not there<br/>
In darker veile) and roseat Dews dispos’d<br/>
All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest,<br/>
Wide over all the Plain, and wider farr<br/>
Then all this globous Earth in Plain outspred,<br/>
(Such are the Courts of God) Th’ Angelic throng<br/>
Disperst in Bands and Files thir Camp extend<br/>
By living Streams among the Trees of Life,<br/>
Pavilions numberless, and sudden reard,<br/>
Celestial Tabernacles, where they slept<br/>
Fannd with coole Winds, save those who in thir course<br/>
Melodious Hymns about the sovran Throne<br/>
Alternate all night long: but not so wak’d<br/>
<i>Satan</i>, so call him now, his former name<br/>
Is heard no more Heav’n; he of the first,<br/>
If not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power,<br/>
In favour and praeeminence, yet fraught<br/>
With envie against the Son of God, that day<br/>
Honourd by his great Father, and proclaimd<br/>
<i>Messiah</i> King anointed, could not beare<br/>
Through pride that sight, and thought himself impaird.<br/>
Deep malice thence conceiving &amp; disdain,<br/>
Soon as midnight brought on the duskie houre<br/>
Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolv’d<br/>
With all his Legions to dislodge, and leave<br/>
Unworshipt, unobey’d the Throne supream<br/>
Contemptuous, and his next subordinate<br/>
Awak’ning, thus to him in secret spake.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Sleepst thou Companion dear, what sleep can close<br/>
Thy eye-lids? and remembrest what Decree<br/>
Of yesterday, so late hath past the lips<br/>
Of Heav’ns Almightie.  Thou to me thy thoughts<br/>
Wast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;<br/>
Both waking we were one; how then can now<br/>
Thy sleep dissent? new Laws thou seest impos’d;<br/>
New Laws from him who reigns, new minds may raise<br/>
In us who serve, new Counsels, to debate<br/>
What doubtful may ensue, more in this place<br/>
To utter is not safe.  Assemble thou<br/>
Of all those Myriads which we lead the chief;<br/>
Tell them that by command, ere yet dim Night<br/>
Her shadowie Cloud withdraws, I am to haste,<br/>
And all who under me thir Banners wave,<br/>
Homeward with flying march where we possess<br/>
The Quarters of the North, there to prepare<br/>
Fit entertainment to receive our King<br/>
The great <i>Messiah</i>, and his new commands,<br/>
Who speedily through all the Hierarchies<br/>
Intends to pass triumphant, and give Laws.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infus’d<br/>
Bad influence into th’ unwarie brest<br/>
Of his Associate; hee together calls,<br/>
Or several one by one, the Regent Powers,<br/>
Under him Regent, tells, as he was taught,<br/>
That the most High commanding, now ere Night,<br/>
Now ere dim Night had disincumberd Heav’n,<br/>
The great Hierarchal Standard was to move;<br/>
Tells the suggested cause, and casts between<br/>
Ambiguous words and jealousies, to sound<br/>
Or taint integritie; but all obey’d<br/>
The wonted signal, and superior voice<br/>
Of thir great Potentate; for great indeed<br/>
His name, and high was his degree in Heav’n;<br/>
His count’nance, as the Morning Starr that guides<br/>
The starrie flock, allur’d them, and with lyes<br/>
Drew after him the third part of Heav’ns Host:<br/>
Mean while th’ Eternal eye, whose sight discernes<br/>
Abstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy Mount<br/>
And from within the golden Lamps that burne<br/>
Nightly before him, saw without thir light<br/>
Rebellion rising, saw in whom, how spred<br/>
Among the sons of Morn, what multitudes<br/>
Were banded to oppose his high Decree;<br/>
And smiling to his onely Son thus said.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Son, thou in whom my glory I behold<br/>
In full resplendence, Heir of all my might,<br/>
Neerly it now concernes us to be sure<br/>
Of our Omnipotence, and with what Arms<br/>
We mean to hold what anciently we claim<br/>
Of Deitie or Empire, such a foe<br/>
Is rising, who intends to erect his Throne<br/>
Equal to ours, throughout the spacious North;<br/>
Nor so content, hath in his thought to trie<br/>
In battel, what our Power is, or our right.<br/>
Let us advise, and to this hazard draw<br/>
With speed what force is left, and all imploy<br/>
In our defence, lest unawares we lose<br/>
This our high place, our Sanctuarie, our Hill.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
To whom the Son with calm aspect and cleer<br/>
Light’ning Divine, ineffable, serene,<br/>
Made answer.  Mightie Father, thou thy foes<br/>
Justly hast in derision, and secure<br/>
Laugh’st at thir vain designes and tumults vain,<br/>
Matter to mee of Glory, whom thir hate<br/>
Illustrates, when they see all Regal Power<br/>
Giv’n me to quell thir pride, and in event<br/>
Know whether I be dextrous to subdue<br/>
Thy Rebels, or be found the worst in Heav’n.<br/>

<p class="poem">
So spake the Son, but <i>Satan</i> with his Powers<br/>
Farr was advanc’t on winged speed, an Host<br/>
Innumerable as the Starrs of Night,<br/>
Or Starrs of Morning, Dew-drops, which the Sun<br/>
Impearls on every leaf and every flouer.<br/>
Regions they pass’d, the mightie Regencies<br/>
Of Seraphim and Potentates and Thrones<br/>
In thir triple Degrees, Regions to which<br/>
All thy Dominion, <i>Adam</i>, is no more<br/>
Then what this Garden is to all the Earth,<br/>
And all the Sea, from one entire globose<br/>
Stretcht into Longitude; which having pass’d<br/>
At length into the limits of the North<br/>
They came, and <i>Satan</i> to his Royal seat<br/>
High on a Hill, far blazing, as a Mount<br/>
Rais’d on a Mount, with Pyramids and Towrs<br/>
From Diamond Quarries hew’n, &amp; Rocks of Gold,<br/>
The Palace of great <i>Lucifer</i>, (so call<br/>
That Structure in the Dialect of men<br/>
Interpreted) which not long after, hee<br/>
Affecting all equality with God,<br/>
In imitation of that Mount whereon<br/>
<i>Messiah</i> was declar’d in sight of Heav’n,<br/>
The Mountain of the Congregation call’d;<br/>
For thither he assembl’d all his Train,<br/>
Pretending so commanded to consult<br/>
About the great reception of thir King,<br/>
Thither to come, and with calumnious Art<br/>
Of counterfeted truth thus held thir ears.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thrones, Dominations, Princedomes, Vertues, Powers,<br/>
If these magnific Titles yet remain<br/>
Not meerly titular, since by Decree<br/>
Another now hath to himself ingross’t<br/>
All Power, and us eclipst under the name<br/>
Of King anointed, for whom all this haste<br/>
Of midnight march, and hurried meeting here,<br/>
This onely to consult how we may best<br/>
With what may be devis’d of honours new<br/>
Receive him coming to receive from us<br/>
Knee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile,<br/>
Too much to one, but double how endur’d,<br/>
To one and to his image now proclaim’d?<br/>
But what if better counsels might erect<br/>
Our minds and teach us to cast off this Yoke?<br/>
Will ye submit your necks, and chuse to bend<br/>
The supple knee? ye will not, if I trust<br/>
To know ye right, or if ye know your selves<br/>
Natives and Sons of Heav’n possest before<br/>
By none, and if not equal all, yet free,<br/>
Equally free; for Orders and Degrees<br/>
Jarr not with liberty, but well consist.<br/>
Who can in reason then or right assume<br/>
Monarchie over such as live by right<br/>
His equals, if in power and splendor less,<br/>
In freedome equal? or can introduce<br/>
Law and Edict on us, who without law<br/>
Erre not, much less for this to be our Lord,<br/>
And look for adoration to th’ abuse<br/>

No more be troubl’d how to quit the yoke<br/>
Of Gods <i>Messiah</i>; those indulgent Laws<br/>
Will not be now voutsaf’t, other Decrees<br/>
Against thee are gon forth without recall;<br/>

Nor number, nor example with him wrought<br/>
To swerve from truth, or change his constant mind<br/>
Though single.  From amidst them forth he passd,<br/>
Long way through hostile scorn, which he susteind<br/>

Through Heav’ns wide Champain held his way, till Morn,<br/>
Wak’t by the circling Hours, with rosie hand<br/>
Unbarr’d the gates of Light.  There is a Cave<br/>
Within the Mount of God, fast by his Throne,<br/>
Where light and darkness in perpetual round<br/>
Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heav’n<br/>
Grateful vicissitude, like Day and Night;<br/>
Light issues forth, and at the other dore<br/>
Obsequious darkness enters, till her houre<br/>
To veile the Heav’n, though darkness there might well<br/>
Seem twilight here; and now went forth the Morn<br/>
Such as in highest Heav’n, arrayd in Gold<br/>
Empyreal, from before her vanisht Night,<br/>
Shot through with orient Beams: when all the Plain<br/>
Coverd with thick embatteld Squadrons bright,<br/>
Chariots and flaming Armes, and fierie Steeds<br/>
Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:<br/>
Warr he perceav’d, warr in procinct, and found<br/>
Already known what he for news had thought<br/>
To have reported: gladly then he mixt<br/>

That of so many Myriads fall’n, yet one<br/>

Universal reproach, far worse to beare<br/>

Rebellious, them with Fire and hostile Arms<br/>
Fearless assault, and to the brow of Heav’n<br/>
Pursuing drive them out from God and bliss,<br/>
Into thir place of punishment, the Gulf<br/>
Of <i>Tartarus</i>, which ready opens wide<br/>
His fiery <i>Chaos</i> to receave thir fall.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake the Sovran voice, and Clouds began<br/>
To darken all the Hill, and smoak to rowl<br/>

Of wrauth awak’t: nor with less dread the loud<br/>
Ethereal Trumpet from on high gan blow:<br/>
At which command the Powers Militant,<br/>
That stood for Heav’n, in mighty Quadrate joyn’d<br/>
Of Union irresistible, mov’d on<br/>
In silence thir bright Legions, to the sound<br/>
Of instrumental Harmonie that breath’d<br/>
Heroic Ardor to advent’rous deeds<br/>
Under thir God-like Leaders, in the Cause<br/>
Of God and his <i>Messiah</i>.  On they move<br/>
Indissolubly firm; nor obvious Hill,<br/>
Nor streit’ning Vale, nor Wood, nor Stream divides<br/>
Thir perfet ranks; for high above the ground<br/>
Thir march was, and the passive Air upbore<br/>
Thir nimble tread; as when the total kind<br/>
Of Birds in orderly array on wing<br/>
Came summond over <i>Eden</i> to receive<br/>
Thir names of thee; so over many a tract<br/>
Of Heav’n they march’d, and many a Province wide<br/>
Tenfold the length of this terrene: at last<br/>
Farr in th’ Horizon to the North appeer’d<br/>
From skirt to skirt a fierie Region, stretcht<br/>
In battailous aspect, and neerer view<br/>
Bristl’d with upright beams innumerable<br/>
Of rigid Spears, and Helmets throng’d, and Shields<br/>
Various, with boastful Argument portraid,<br/>
The banded Powers of <i>Satan</i> hasting on<br/>
With furious expedition; for they weend<br/>
That self same day by fight, or by surprize<br/>
To win the Mount of God, and on his Throne<br/>
To set the envier of his State, the proud<br/>
Aspirer, but thir thoughts prov’d fond and vain<br/>
In the mid way: though strange to us it seemd<br/>
At first, that Angel should with Angel warr,<br/>
And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet<br/>
So oft in Festivals of joy and love<br/>
Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire<br/>
Hymning th’ Eternal Father: but the shout<br/>
Of Battel now began, and rushing sound<br/>
Of onset ended soon each milder thought.<br/>
High in the midst exalted as a God<br/>
Th’ Apostat in his Sun-bright Chariot sate<br/>
Idol of Majestie Divine, enclos’d<br/>
With Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields;<br/>
Then lighted from his gorgeous Throne, for now<br/>
’Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left,<br/>
A dreadful interval, and Front to Front<br/>
Presented stood in terrible array<br/>
Of hideous length: before the cloudie Van,<br/>
On the rough edge of battel ere it joyn’d,<br/>
<i>Satan</i> with vast and haughtie strides advanc’t,<br/>
Came towring, armd in Adamant and Gold;<br/>
<i>Abdiel</i> that sight endur’d not, where he stood<br/>
Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,<br/>
And thus his own undaunted heart explores.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O Heav’n! that such resemblance of the Highest<br/>
Should yet remain, where faith and realtie<br/>

His puissance, trusting in th’ Almightie’s aide,<br/>
I mean to try, whose Reason I have tri’d<br/>
Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just,<br/>
That he who in debate of Truth hath won,<br/>
Should win in Arms, in both disputes alike<br/>
Victor; though brutish that contest and foule,<br/>

So pondering, and from his armed Peers<br/>

Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reacht<br/>

Or potent tongue; fool, not to think how vain<br/>
Against th’ Omnipotent to rise in Arms;<br/>
Who out of smallest things could without end<br/>
Have rais’d incessant Armies to defeat<br/>
Thy folly; or with solitarie hand<br/>
Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow<br/>
Unaided could have finisht thee, and whelmd<br/>

Thy merited reward, the first assay<br/>
Of this right hand provok’t, since first that tongue<br/>
Inspir’d with contradiction durst oppose<br/>
A third part of the Gods, in Synod met<br/>
Thir Deities to assert, who while they feel<br/>
Vigour Divine within them, can allow<br/>
Omnipotence to none.  But well thou comst<br/>
Before thy fellows, ambitious to win<br/>
From me som Plume, that thy success may show<br/>
Destruction to the rest: this pause between<br/>
(Unanswerd least thou boast) to let thee know;<br/>
At first I thought that Libertie and Heav’n<br/>

To whom in brief thus <i>Abdiel</i> stern repli’d.<br/>

Of erring, from the path of truth remote:<br/>
Unjustly thou deprav’st it with the name<br/>
Of <i>Servitude</i> to serve whom God ordains,<br/>
Or Nature; God and Nature bid the same,<br/>
When he who rules is worthiest, and excells<br/>
Them whom he governs.  This is servitude,<br/>
To serve th’ unwise, or him who hath rebelld<br/>
Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,<br/>
Thy self not free, but to thy self enthrall’d;<br/>
Yet leudly dar’st our ministring upbraid.<br/>
Reign thou in Hell thy Kingdom, let mee serve<br/>
In Heav’n God ever blessed, and his Divine<br/>

<p class="poem">
So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high,<br/>
Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell<br/>
On the proud Crest of <i>Satan</i>, that no sight,<br/>
Nor motion of swift thought, less could his Shield<br/>
Such ruin intercept: ten paces huge<br/>
He back recoild; the tenth on bended knee<br/>
His massie Spear upstaid; as if on Earth<br/>
Winds under ground or waters forcing way<br/>
Sidelong, had push’t a Mountain from his seat<br/>
Half sunk with all his Pines.  Amazement seis’d<br/>
The Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see<br/>
Thus foil’d thir mightiest, ours joy filld, and shout,<br/>
Presage of Victorie and fierce desire<br/>
Of Battel: whereat <i>Michael</i> bid sound<br/>
Th’ Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heav’n<br/>
It sounded, and the faithful Armies rung<br/>
<i>Hosanna</i> to the Highest: nor stood at gaze<br/>
The adverse Legions, nor less hideous joyn’d<br/>
The horrid shock: now storming furie rose,<br/>
And clamour such as heard in Heav’n till now<br/>
Was never, Arms on Armour clashing bray’d<br/>
Horrible discord, and the madding Wheeles<br/>
Of brazen Chariots rag’d; dire was the noise<br/>
Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss<br/>
Of fiery Darts in flaming volies flew,<br/>
And flying vaulted either Host with fire.<br/>
Sounder fierie Cope together rush’d<br/>
Both Battels maine, with ruinous assault<br/>
And inextinguishable rage; all Heav’n<br/>
Resounded, and had Earth bin then, all Earth<br/>
Had to her Center shook.  What wonder? when<br/>
Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought<br/>
On either side, the least of whom could weild<br/>
These Elements, and arm him with the force<br/>
Of all thir Regions: how much more of Power<br/>
Armie against Armie numberless to raise<br/>
Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb,<br/>
Though not destroy, thir happie Native seat;<br/>
Had not th’ Eternal King Omnipotent<br/>
From his strong hold of Heav’n high over-rul’d<br/>
And limited thir might; though numberd such<br/>
As each divided Legion might have seemd<br/>
A numerous Host, in strength each armed hand<br/>
A Legion; led in fight, yet Leader seemd<br/>
Each Warriour single as in Chief, expert<br/>
When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway<br/>
Of Battel, open when, and when to close<br/>
The ridges of grim Warr; no thought of flight,<br/>
None of retreat, no unbecoming deed<br/>
That argu’d fear; each on himself reli’d,<br/>
As onely in his arm the moment lay<br/>
Of victorie; deeds of eternal fame<br/>
Were don, but infinite: for wide was spred<br/>
That Warr and various; somtimes on firm ground<br/>
A standing fight, then soaring on main wing<br/>
Tormented all the Air; all Air seemd then<br/>
Conflicting Fire: long time in eeven scale<br/>
The Battel hung; till <i>Satan</i>, who that day<br/>
Prodigious power had shewn, and met in Armes<br/>
No equal, raunging through the dire attack<br/>
Of fighting Seraphim confus’d, at length<br/>
Saw where the Sword of <i>Michael</i> smote, and fell’d<br/>
Squadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway<br/>
Brandisht aloft the horrid edge came down<br/>
Wide wasting; such destruction to withstand<br/>
He hasted, and oppos’d the rockie Orb<br/>
Of tenfold Adamant, his ample Shield<br/>
A vast circumference: At his approach<br/>
The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toile<br/>
Surceas’d, and glad as hoping here to end<br/>
Intestine War in Heav’n, the arch foe subdu’d<br/>
Or Captive drag’d in Chains, with hostile frown<br/>
And visage all enflam’d first thus began.<br/>

<p class="poem">
Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt,<br/>
Unnam’d in Heav’n, now plenteous, as thou seest<br/>
These Acts of hateful strife, hateful to all,<br/>
Though heaviest by just measure on thy self<br/>
And thy adherents: how hast thou disturb’d<br/>
Heav’ns blessed peace, and into Nature brought<br/>
Miserie, uncreated till the crime<br/>
Of thy Rebellion? how hast thou instill’d<br/>
Thy malice into thousands, once upright<br/>
And faithful, now prov’d false.  But think not here<br/>
To trouble Holy Rest; Heav’n casts thee out<br/>
From all her Confines.  Heav’n the seat of bliss<br/>

They ended parle, and both addrest for fight<br/>
Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue<br/>
Of Angels, can relate, or to what things<br/>
Liken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift<br/>
Human imagination to such highth<br/>
Of Godlike Power: for likest Gods they seemd,<br/>
Stood they or mov’d, in stature, motion, arms<br/>
Fit to decide the Empire of great Heav’n.<br/>
Now wav’d thir fierie Swords, and in the Aire<br/>
Made horrid Circles; two broad Suns thir Shields<br/>
Blaz’d opposite, while expectation stood<br/>
In horror; from each hand with speed retir’d<br/>
Where erst was thickest fight, th’ Angelic throng,<br/>
And left large field, unsafe within the wind<br/>
Of such commotion, such as to set forth<br/>
Great things by small, If Natures concord broke,<br/>
Among the Constellations warr were sprung,<br/>
Two Planets rushing from aspect maligne<br/>
Of fiercest opposition in mid Skie,<br/>
Should combat, and thir jarring Sphears confound.<br/>
Together both with next to Almightie Arme,<br/>
Uplifted imminent one stroke they aim’d<br/>
That might determine, and not need repeate,<br/>
As not of power, at once; nor odds appeerd<br/>
In might or swift prevention; but the sword<br/>
Of <i>Michael</i> from the Armorie of God<br/>
Was giv’n him temperd so, that neither keen<br/>
Nor solid might resist that edge: it met<br/>
The sword of <i>Satan</i> with steep force to smite<br/>
Descending, and in half cut sheere, nor staid,<br/>
But with swift wheele reverse, deep entring shar’d<br/>
All his right side; then <i>Satan</i> first knew pain,<br/>
And writh’d him to and fro convolv’d; so sore<br/>
The griding sword with discontinuous wound<br/>
Pass’d through him, but th’ Ethereal substance clos’d<br/>
Not long divisible, and from the gash<br/>
A stream of Nectarous humor issuing flow’d<br/>
Sanguin, such as Celestial Spirits may bleed,<br/>
And all his Armour staind ere while so bright.<br/>
Forthwith on all sides to his aide was run<br/>
By Angels many and strong, who interpos’d<br/>
Defence, while others bore him on thir Shields<br/>
Back to his Chariot; where it stood retir’d<br/>
From off the files of warr; there they him laid<br/>
Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame<br/>
To find himself not matchless, and his pride<br/>
Humbl’d by such rebuke, so farr beneath<br/>
His confidence to equal God in power.<br/>
Yet soon he heal’d; for Spirits that live throughout<br/>
Vital in every part, not as frail man<br/>
In Entrailes, Heart or Head, Liver or Reines,<br/>
Cannot but by annihilating die;<br/>
Nor in thir liquid texture mortal wound<br/>
Receive, no more then can the fluid Aire:<br/>
All Heart they live, all Head, all Eye, all Eare,<br/>
All Intellect, all Sense, and as they please,<br/>
They Limb themselves, and colour, shape or size<br/>
Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare.<br/>

Threatn’d, nor from the Holie One of Heav’n<br/>

What we propound, and loud that all may hear.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce<br/>
Had ended; when to Right and Left the Front<br/>
Divided, and to either Flank retir’d.<br/>
Which to our eyes discoverd new and strange,<br/>
A triple-mounted row of Pillars laid<br/>
On Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seem’d<br/>
Or hollow’d bodies made of Oak or Firr<br/>
With branches lopt, in Wood or Mountain fell’d)<br/>
Brass, Iron, Stonie mould, had not thir mouthes<br/>
With hideous orifice gap’t on us wide,<br/>
Portending hollow truce; at each behind<br/>
A Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed<br/>
Stood waving tipt with fire; while we suspense,<br/>
Collected stood within our thoughts amus’d,<br/>
Not long, for sudden all at once thir Reeds<br/>
Put forth, and to a narrow vent appli’d<br/>
With nicest touch.  Immediate in a flame,<br/>
But soon obscur’d with smoak, all Heav’n appeerd,<br/>
From those deep-throated Engins belcht, whose roar<br/>
Emboweld with outragious noise the Air,<br/>
And all her entrails tore, disgorging foule<br/>
Thir devillish glut, chaind Thunderbolts and Hail<br/>
Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host<br/>
Level’d, with such impetuous furie smote,<br/>
That whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand,<br/>
Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell<br/>
By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rowl’d;<br/>
The sooner for thir Arms, unarm’d they might<br/>
Have easily as Spirits evaded swift<br/>
By quick contraction or remove; but now<br/>
Foule dissipation follow’d and forc’t rout;<br/>
Nor serv’d it to relax thir serried files.<br/>
What should they do? if on they rusht, repulse<br/>
Repeated, and indecent overthrow<br/>
Doubl’d, would render them yet more despis’d,<br/>
And to thir foes a laughter; for in view<br/>
Stood rankt of Seraphim another row<br/>
In posture to displode thir second tire<br/>
Of Thunder: back defeated to return<br/>
They worse abhorr’d.  <i>Satan</i> beheld thir plight,<br/>
And to his Mates thus in derision call’d.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud?<br/>
Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee,<br/>
To entertain them fair with open Front<br/>
And Brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms<br/>
Of composition, strait they chang’d thir minds,<br/>
Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,<br/>
As they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd<br/>
Somwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps<br/>
For joy of offerd peace: but I suppose<br/>
If our proposals once again were heard<br/>
We should compel them to a quick result.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
To whom thus <i>Belial</i> in like gamesom mood.<br/>
Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight,<br/>
Of hard contents, and full of force urg’d home,<br/>
Such as we might perceive amus’d them all,<br/>
And stumbl’d many, who receives them right,<br/>
Had need from head to foot well understand;<br/>
Not understood, this gift they have besides,<br/>
They shew us when our foes walk not upright.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So they among themselves in pleasant veine<br/>
Stood scoffing, highthn’d in thir thoughts beyond<br/>
All doubt of Victorie, eternal might<br/>
To match with thir inventions they presum’d<br/>
So easie, and of his Thunder made a scorn,<br/>
And all his Host derided, while they stood<br/>
A while in trouble; but they stood not long,<br/>
Rage prompted them at length, &amp; found them arms<br/>
Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.<br/>
Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power<br/>
Which God hath in his mighty Angels plac’d)<br/>
Thir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills<br/>
(For Earth hath this variety from Heav’n<br/>
Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale)<br/>
Light as the Lightning glimps they ran, they flew,<br/>
From thir foundations loosning to and fro<br/>
They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load,<br/>
Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops<br/>
Up lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze,<br/>
Be sure, and terrour seis’d the rebel Host,<br/>
When coming towards them so dread they saw<br/>
The bottom of the Mountains upward turn’d,<br/>
Till on those cursed Engins triple-row<br/>
They saw them whelmd, and all thir confidence<br/>
Under the weight of Mountains buried deep,<br/>
Themselves invaded next, and on thir heads<br/>
Main Promontories flung, which in the Air<br/>
Came shadowing, and opprest whole Legions arm’d,<br/>
Thir armor help’d thir harm, crush’t in and brus’d<br/>
Into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain<br/>
Implacable, and many a dolorous groan,<br/>
Long strugling underneath, ere they could wind<br/>
Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light,<br/>
Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown.<br/>
The rest in imitation to like Armes<br/>
Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore;<br/>
So Hills amid the Air encounterd Hills<br/>
Hurl’d to and fro with jaculation dire,<br/>
That under ground they fought in dismal shade;<br/>
Infernal noise; Warr seem’d a civil Game<br/>
To this uproar; horrid confusion heapt<br/>
Upon confusion rose: and now all Heav’n<br/>
Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspred,<br/>
Had not th’ Almightie Father where he sits<br/>
Shrin’d in his Sanctuarie of Heav’n secure,<br/>
Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen<br/>
This tumult, and permitted all, advis’d:<br/>
That his great purpose he might so fulfill,<br/>
To honour his Anointed Son aveng’d<br/>
Upon his enemies, and to declare<br/>
All power on him transferr’d: whence to his Son<br/>
Th’ Assessor of his Throne he thus began.<br/>

<p class="poem">
Effulgence of my Glorie, Son belov’d,<br/>
Son in whose face invisible is beheld<br/>
Visibly, what by Deitie I am,<br/>
And in whose hand what by Decree I doe,<br/>
Second Omnipotence, two dayes are past,<br/>
Two dayes, as we compute the dayes of Heav’n,<br/>
Since <i>Michael</i> and his Powers went forth to tame<br/>
These disobedient; sore hath been thir fight,<br/>
As likeliest was, when two such Foes met arm’d;<br/>
For to themselves I left them, and thou knowst,<br/>
Equal in their Creation they were form’d,<br/>
Save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought<br/>
Insensibly, for I suspend thir doom;<br/>
Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last<br/>
Endless, and no solution will be found:<br/>
Warr wearied hath perform’d what Warr can do,<br/>
And to disorder’d rage let loose the reines,<br/>
With Mountains as with Weapons arm’d, which makes<br/>
Wild work in Heav’n, and dangerous to the maine.<br/>
Two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine;<br/>
For thee I have ordain’d it, and thus farr<br/>
Have sufferd, that the Glorie may be thine<br/>
Of ending this great Warr, since none but Thou<br/>
Can end it.  Into thee such Vertue and Grace<br/>
Immense I have transfus’d, that all may know<br/>
In Heav’n and Hell thy Power above compare,<br/>
And this perverse Commotion governd thus,<br/>
To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir<br/>
Of all things, to be Heir and to be King<br/>
By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right.<br/>
Go then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might,<br/>
Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheeles<br/>
That shake Heav’ns basis, bring forth all my Warr,<br/>
My Bow and Thunder, my Almightie Arms<br/>
Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh;<br/>
Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out<br/>
From all Heav’ns bounds into the utter Deep:<br/>
There let them learn, as likes them, to despise<br/>
God and <i>Messiah</i> his anointed King.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
He said, and on his Son with Rayes direct<br/>
Shon full, he all his Father full exprest<br/>
Ineffably into his face receiv’d,<br/>
And thus the filial Godhead answering spake.<br/>

<p class="poem">
O Father, O Supream of heav’nly Thrones,<br/>
First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou alwayes seekst<br/>
To glorifie thy Son, I alwayes thee,<br/>
As is most just; this I my Glorie account,<br/>
My exaltation, and my whole delight,<br/>
That thou in me well pleas’d, declarst thy will<br/>
Fulfill’d, which to fulfil is all my bliss.<br/>
Scepter and Power, thy giving, I assume,<br/>
And gladlier shall resign, when in the end<br/>
Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee<br/>
For ever, and in mee all whom thou lov’st:<br/>
But whom thou hat’st, I hate, and can put on<br/>
Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on,<br/>
Image of thee in all things; and shall soon,<br/>
Armd with thy might, rid heav’n of these rebell’d,<br/>
To thir prepar’d ill Mansion driven down<br/>
To chains of Darkness, and th’ undying Worm,<br/>
That from thy just obedience could revolt,<br/>
Whom to obey is happiness entire.<br/>
Then shall thy Saints unmixt, and from th’ impure<br/>
Farr separate, circling thy holy Mount<br/>
Unfained <i>Halleluiahs</i> to thee sing,<br/>
Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief.<br/>
So said, he o’re his Scepter bowing, rose<br/>
From the right hand of Glorie where he sate,<br/>
And the third sacred Morn began to shine<br/>
Dawning through Heav’n: forth rush’d with whirlwind sound<br/>
The Chariot of Paternal Deitie,<br/>
Flashing thick flames, Wheele within Wheele undrawn,<br/>
It self instinct with Spirit, but convoyd<br/>
By four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each<br/>
Had wondrous, as with Starrs thir bodies all<br/>
And Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the Wheels<br/>
Of Beril, and careering Fires between;<br/>
Over thir heads a chrystal Firmament,<br/>
Whereon a Saphir Throne, inlaid with pure<br/>
Amber, and colours of the showrie Arch.<br/>
Hee in Celestial Panoplie all armd<br/>
Of radiant <i>Urim</i>, work divinely wrought,<br/>
Ascended, at his right hand Victorie<br/>
Sate Eagle-wing’d, beside him hung his Bow<br/>
And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stor’d,<br/>
And from about him fierce Effusion rowld<br/>
Of smoak and bickering flame, and sparkles dire;<br/>
Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints,<br/>
He onward came, farr off his coming shon,<br/>
And twentie thousand (I thir number heard)<br/>
Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen:<br/>
Hee on the wings of Cherub rode sublime<br/>
On the Crystallin Skie, in Saphir Thron’d.<br/>
Illustrious farr and wide, but by his own<br/>
First seen, them unexpected joy surpriz’d,<br/>
When the great Ensign of <i>Messiah</i> blaz’d<br/>
Aloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heav’n:<br/>
Under whose Conduct <i>Michael</i> soon reduc’d<br/>
His Armie, circumfus’d on either Wing,<br/>
Under thir Head imbodied all in one.<br/>
Before him Power Divine his way prepar’d;<br/>
At his command the uprooted Hills retir’d<br/>
Each to his place, they heard his voice and went<br/>
Obsequious, Heav’n his wonted face renewd,<br/>
And with fresh Flourets Hill and Valley smil’d.<br/>
This saw his hapless Foes, but stood obdur’d,<br/>
And to rebellious fight rallied thir Powers<br/>
Insensate, hope conceiving from despair.<br/>
In heav’nly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?<br/>
But to convince the proud what Signs availe,<br/>
Or Wonders move th’ obdurate to relent?<br/>
They hard’nd more by what might most reclame,<br/>
Grieving to see his Glorie, at the sight<br/>
Took envie, and aspiring to his highth,<br/>
Stood reimbattell’d fierce, by force or fraud<br/>
Weening to prosper, and at length prevaile<br/>
Against God and <i>Messiah</i>, or to fall<br/>
In universal ruin last, and now<br/>
To final Battel drew, disdaining flight,<br/>
Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God<br/>
To all his Host on either hand thus spake.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Stand still in bright array ye Saints, here stand<br/>
Ye Angels arm’d, this day from Battel rest;<br/>
Faithful hath been your Warfare, and of God<br/>
Accepted, fearless in his righteous Cause,<br/>
And as ye have receivd, so have ye don<br/>
Invincibly; but of this cursed crew<br/>
The punishment to other hand belongs,<br/>
Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints;<br/>
Number to this dayes work is not ordain’d<br/>
Nor multitude, stand onely and behold<br/>
Gods indignation on these Godless pourd<br/>
By mee; not you but mee they have despis’d,<br/>
Yet envied; against mee is all thir rage,<br/>
Because the Father, t’ whom in Heav’n supream<br/>
Kingdom and Power and Glorie appertains,<br/>
Hath honourd me according to his will.<br/>
Therefore to mee thir doom he hath assig’n’d;<br/>
That they may have thir wish, to trie with mee<br/>
In Battel which the stronger proves, they all,<br/>
Or I alone against them, since by strength<br/>
They measure all, of other excellence<br/>
Not emulous, nor care who them excells;<br/>
Nor other strife with them do I voutsafe.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake the Son, and into terrour chang’d<br/>
His count’nance too severe to be beheld<br/>
And full of wrauth bent on his Enemies.<br/>
At once the Four spred out thir Starrie wings<br/>
With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbes<br/>
Of his fierce Chariot rowld, as with the sound<br/>
Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host.<br/>
Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove,<br/>
Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles<br/>
The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout,<br/>
All but the Throne it self of God.  Full soon<br/>
Among them he arriv’d; in his right hand<br/>
Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent<br/>
Before him, such as in thir Soules infix’d<br/>
Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost,<br/>
All courage; down thir idle weapons drop’d;<br/>
O’re Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode<br/>
Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,<br/>
That wish’d the Mountains now might be again<br/>
Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire.<br/>
Nor less on either side tempestuous fell<br/>
His arrows, from the fourfold-visag’d Foure,<br/>
Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels,<br/>
Distinct alike with multitude of eyes,<br/>
One Spirit in them rul’d, and every eye<br/>
Glar’d lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire<br/>
Among th’ accurst, that witherd all thir strength,<br/>
And of thir wonted vigour left them draind,<br/>
Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall’n.<br/>
Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check’d<br/>
His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant<br/>
Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav’n:<br/>
The overthrown he rais’d, and as a Heard<br/>
Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd<br/>
Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu’d<br/>
With terrors and with furies to the bounds<br/>
And Chrystall wall of Heav’n, which op’ning wide,<br/>
Rowld inward, and a spacious Gap disclos’d<br/>
Into the wastful Deep; the monstrous sight<br/>
Strook them with horror backward, but far worse<br/>
Urg’d them behind; headlong themselvs they threw<br/>
Down from the verge of Heav’n, Eternal wrauth<br/>
Burnt after them to the bottomless pit.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Hell heard th’ unsufferable noise, Hell saw<br/>
Heav’n ruining from Heav’n and would have fled<br/>
Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep<br/>
Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound.<br/>
Nine dayes they fell; confounded <i>Chaos</i> roard,<br/>
And felt tenfold confusion in thir fall<br/>
Through his wilde Anarchie, so huge a rout<br/>
Incumberd him with ruin: Hell at last<br/>
Yawning receavd them whole, and on them clos’d,<br/>
Hell thir fit habitation fraught with fire<br/>
Unquenchable, the house of woe and paine.<br/>
Disburd’nd Heav’n rejoic’d, and soon repaird<br/>
Her mural breach, returning whence it rowld.<br/>
Sole Victor from th’ expulsion of his Foes<br/>
<i>Messiah</i> his triumphal Chariot turnd:<br/>
To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood<br/>
Eye witnesses of his Almightie Acts,<br/>
With Jubilie advanc’d; and as they went,<br/>
Shaded with branching Palme, each order bright,<br/>
Sung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King,<br/>
Son, Heire, and Lord, to him Dominion giv’n,<br/>
Worthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode<br/>
Triumphant through mid Heav’n, into the Courts<br/>
And Temple of his mightie Father Thron’d<br/>
On high; who into Glorie him receav’d,<br/>
Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thus measuring things in Heav’n by things on Earth<br/>
At thy request, and that thou maist beware<br/>
By what is past, to thee I have reveal’d<br/>
What might have else to human Race bin hid;<br/>
The discord which befel, and Warr in Heav’n<br/>
Among th’ Angelic Powers, and the deep fall<br/>
Of those too high aspiring, who rebelld<br/>
With <i>Satan</i>, hee who envies now thy state,<br/>
Who now is plotting how he may seduce<br/>
Thee also from obedience, that with him<br/>
Bereavd of happiness thou maist partake<br/>
His punishment, Eternal miserie;<br/>
Which would be all his solace and revenge,<br/>
As a despite don against the most High,<br/>
Thee once to gaine Companion of his woe.<br/>
But list’n not to his Temptations, warne<br/>
Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard<br/>
By terrible Example the reward<br/>
Of disobedience; firm they might have stood,<br/>
Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.<br/>

Of old <i>Olympus</i> dwell’st, but Heav’nlie borne,<br/>
Before the Hills appeerd, or Fountain flow’d,<br/>
Thou with Eternal wisdom didst converse,<br/>
Wisdom thy Sister, and with her didst play<br/>
In presence of th’ Almightie Father, pleas’d<br/>
With thy Celestial Song.  Up led by thee<br/>

An Earthlie Guest, and drawn Empyreal Aire,<br/>

On evil dayes though fall’n, and evil tongues;<br/>

But drive farr off the barbarous dissonance<br/>
Of <i>Bacchus</i> and his Revellers, the Race<br/>
Of that wilde Rout that tore the <i>Thracian</i> Bard<br/>
In <i>Rhodope</i>, where Woods and Rocks had Eares<br/>
To rapture, till the savage clamor dround<br/>
Both Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defend<br/>

Say Goddess, what ensu’d when <i>Raphael</i>,<br/>

Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know<br/>
What neerer might concern him, how this World<br/>
Of Heav’n and Earth conspicuous first began,<br/>
When, and whereof created, for what cause,<br/>
What within <i>Eden</i> or without was done<br/>
Before his memorie, as one whose drouth<br/>

Great things, and full of wonder in our eares,<br/>
Farr differing from this World, thou hast reveal’d<br/>
Divine Interpreter, by favour sent<br/>
Down from the Empyrean to forewarne<br/>
Us timely of what might else have bin our loss,<br/>
Unknown, which human knowledg could not reach:<br/>
For which to the infinitly Good we owe<br/>
Immortal thanks, and his admonishment<br/>
Receave with solemne purpose to observe<br/>
Immutably his sovran will, the end<br/>
Of what we are.  But since thou hast voutsaf’t<br/>
Gently for our instruction to impart<br/>
Things above Earthly thought, which yet concernd<br/>
Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemd,<br/>
Deign to descend now lower, and relate<br/>
What may no less perhaps availe us known,<br/>
How first began this Heav’n which we behold<br/>
Distant so high, with moving Fires adornd<br/>
Innumerable, and this which yeelds or fills<br/>
All space, the ambient Aire wide interfus’d<br/>
Imbracing round this florid Earth, what cause<br/>
Mov’d the Creator in his holy Rest<br/>
Through all Eternitie so late to build<br/>
In <i>Chaos</i>, and the work begun, how soon<br/>
Absolv’d, if unforbid thou maist unfould<br/>
What wee, not to explore the secrets aske<br/>
Of his Eternal Empire, but the more<br/>
To magnifie his works, the more we know.<br/>
And the great Light of Day yet wants to run<br/>
Much of his Race though steep, suspens in Heav’n<br/>
Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he heares,<br/>
And longer will delay to heare thee tell<br/>
His Generation, and the rising Birth<br/>
Of Nature from the unapparent Deep:<br/>
Or if the Starr of Eevning and the Moon<br/>
Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring<br/>
Silence, and Sleep listning to thee will watch,<br/>

End, and dismiss thee ere the Morning shine.<br/>

Thus <i>Adam</i> his illustrous Guest besought:</p>

This also thy request with caution askt<br/>
Obtaine: though to recount Almightie works<br/>
What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice,<br/>

Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve<br/>
To glorifie the Maker, and inferr<br/>
Thee also happier, shall not be withheld<br/>

To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope<br/>
Things not reveal’d, which th’ invisible King,<br/>
Onely Omniscient, hath supprest in Night,<br/>

Anough is left besides to search and know.<br/>
But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less<br/>

Infinitude, nor vacuous the space.<br/>
Though I uncircumscrib’d my self retire,<br/>
And put not forth my goodness, which is free<br/>
To act or not, Necessitie and Chance<br/>
Approach not mee, and what I will is Fate.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake th’ Almightie, and to what he spake<br/>
His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect.<br/>
Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift<br/>
Then time or motion, but to human ears<br/>
Cannot without process of speech be told,<br/>
So told as earthly notion can receave.<br/>
Great triumph and rejoycing was in Heav’n<br/>
When such was heard declar’d the Almightie’s will;<br/>
Glorie they sung to the most High, good will<br/>
To future men, and in thir dwellings peace:<br/>
Glorie to him whose just avenging ire<br/>
Had driven out th’ ungodly from his sight<br/>
And th’ habitations of the just; to him<br/>
Glorie and praise, whose wisdom had ordain’d<br/>
Good out of evil to create, in stead<br/>
Of Spirits maligne a better Race to bring<br/>
Into thir vacant room, and thence diffuse<br/>
His good to Worlds and Ages infinite.<br/>
So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son<br/>
On his great Expedition now appeer’d,<br/>
Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crown’d<br/>
Of Majestie Divine, Sapience and Love<br/>
Immense, and all his Father in him shon.<br/>
About his Chariot numberless were pour’d<br/>
Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones,<br/>
And Vertues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wing’d,<br/>
From the Armoury of God, where stand of old<br/>
Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodg’d<br/>
Against a solemn day, harnest at hand,<br/>
Celestial Equipage; and now came forth<br/>
Spontaneous, for within them Spirit livd,<br/>
Attendant on thir Lord: Heav’n op’nd wide<br/>
Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound<br/>
On golden Hinges moving, to let forth<br/>
The King of Glorie in his powerful Word<br/>
And Spirit coming to create new Worlds.<br/>
On heav’nly ground they stood, and from the shore<br/>
They view’d the vast immeasurable Abyss<br/>
Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde,<br/>
Up from the bottom turn’d by furious windes<br/>
And surging waves, as Mountains to assault<br/>
Heav’ns highth, and with the Center mix the Pole.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Silence, ye troubl’d waves, and thou Deep, peace,<br/>
Said then th’ Omnific Word, your discord end:<br/>

<p class="poem">
Nor staid, but on the Wings of Cherubim<br/>
Uplifted, in Paternal Glorie rode<br/>
Farr into <i>Chaos</i>, and the World unborn;<br/>
For <i>Chaos</i> heard his voice: him all his Traine<br/>
Follow’d in bright procession to behold<br/>
Creation, and the wonders of his might.<br/>
Then staid the fervid Wheeles, and in his hand<br/>
He took the golden Compasses, prepar’d<br/>
In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe<br/>
This Universe, and all created things:<br/>
One foot he center’d, and the other turn’d<br/>
Round through the vast profunditie obscure,<br/>
And said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds,<br/>
This be thy just Circumference, O World.<br/>
Thus God the Heav’n created, thus the Earth,<br/>
Matter unform’d and void: Darkness profound<br/>
Cover’d th’ Abyss: but on the watrie calme<br/>
His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspred,<br/>
And vital vertue infus’d, and vital warmth<br/>
Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purg’d<br/>
The black tartareous cold infernal dregs<br/>
Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob’d<br/>
Like things to like, the rest to several place<br/>
Disparted, and between spun out the Air,<br/>

Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light<br/>
Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure<br/>
Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East<br/>
To journie through the airie gloom began,<br/>
Sphear’d in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun<br/>
Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle<br/>
Sojourn’d the while.  God saw the Light was good;<br/>
And light from darkness by the Hemisphere<br/>
Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night<br/>
He nam’d.  Thus was the first Day Eev’n and Morn:<br/>
Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung<br/>
By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light<br/>
Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld;<br/>
Birth-day of Heav’n and Earth; with joy and shout<br/>
The hollow Universal Orb they fill’d,<br/>
And touch’t thir Golden Harps, &amp; hymning prais’d<br/>

Again, God said, let ther be Firmament<br/>
Amid the Waters, and let it divide<br/>

The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,<br/>
Transparent, Elemental Air, diffus’d<br/>
In circuit to the uttermost convex<br/>
Of this great Round: partition firm and sure,<br/>
The Waters underneath from those above<br/>
Dividing: for as Earth, so hee the World<br/>
Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide<br/>
Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule<br/>
Of <i>Chaos</i> farr remov’d, least fierce extreames<br/>
Contiguous might distemper the whole frame:<br/>
And Heav’n he nam’d the Firmament: So Eev’n<br/>

<p class="poem">
The Earth was form’d, but in the Womb as yet<br/>
Of Waters, Embryon immature involv’d,<br/>

Main Ocean flow’d, not idle, but with warme<br/>
Prolific humour soft’ning all her Globe,<br/>
Fermented the great Mother to conceave,<br/>
Satiate with genial moisture, when God said<br/>
Be gather’d now ye Waters under Heav’n<br/>
Into one place, and let dry Land appeer.<br/>
Immediately the Mountains huge appeer<br/>
Emergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave<br/>
Into the Clouds, thir tops ascend the Skie:<br/>
So high as heav’d the tumid Hills, so low<br/>
Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,<br/>
Capacious bed of Waters: thither they<br/>
Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld<br/>
As drops on dust conglobing from the drie;<br/>
Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct,<br/>
For haste; such flight the great command impress’d<br/>
On the swift flouds: as Armies at the call<br/>
Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou hast heard)<br/>
Troop to thir Standard, so the watrie throng,<br/>
Wave rowling after Wave, where way they found,<br/>
If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plaine,<br/>
Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill,<br/>
But they, or under ground, or circuit wide<br/>
With Serpent errour wandring, found thir way,<br/>
And on the washie Oose deep Channels wore;<br/>
Easie, e’re God had bid the ground be drie,<br/>
All but within those banks, where Rivers now<br/>
Stream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine.<br/>
The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle<br/>
Of congregated Waters he call’d Seas:<br/>
And saw that it was good, and said, Let th’ Earth<br/>
Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yeilding Seed,<br/>
And Fruit Tree yeilding Fruit after her kind;<br/>
Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth.<br/>
He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then<br/>
Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn’d,<br/>
Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad<br/>
Her Universal Face with pleasant green,<br/>
Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour’d<br/>
Op’ning thir various colours, and made gay<br/>
Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown,<br/>
Forth flourish’t thick the clustring Vine, forth crept<br/>
The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed<br/>
Embattell’d in her field: add the humble Shrub,<br/>
And Bush with frizl’d hair implicit: last<br/>
Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred<br/>
Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm’d<br/>
Thir Blossoms: with high Woods the Hills were crownd,<br/>
With tufts the vallies &amp; each fountain side,<br/>
With borders long the Rivers.  That Earth now<br/>
Seemd like to Heav’n, a seat where Gods might dwell,<br/>
Or wander with delight, and love to haunt<br/>
Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rain’d<br/>
Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground<br/>
None was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist<br/>
Went up and waterd all the ground, and each<br/>
Plant of the field, which e’re it was in the Earth<br/>
God made, and every Herb, before it grew<br/>
On the green stemm; God saw that it was good:<br/>
So Eev’n and Morn recorded the Third Day.<br/>

<p class="poem">
Again th’ Almightie spake: Let there be Lights<br/>
High in th’ expanse of Heaven to divide<br/>
The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes,<br/>
For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years,<br/>
And let them be for Lights as I ordaine<br/>
Thir Office in the Firmament of Heav’n<br/>
To give Light on the Earth; and it was so.<br/>
And God made two great Lights, great for thir use<br/>
To Man, the greater to have rule by Day,<br/>
The less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs,<br/>
And set them in the Firmament of Heav’n<br/>
To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day<br/>
In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night,<br/>
And Light from Darkness to divide.  God saw,<br/>
Surveying his great Work, that it was good:<br/>
For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun<br/>
A mightie Spheare he fram’d, unlightsom first,<br/>
Though of Ethereal Mould: then form’d the Moon<br/>
Globose, and everie magnitude of Starrs,<br/>
And sowd with Starrs the Heav’n thick as a field:<br/>
Of Light by farr the greater part he took,<br/>
Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac’d<br/>
In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive<br/>
And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine<br/>
Her gather’d beams, great Palace now of Light.<br/>
Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs<br/>
Repairing, in thir gold’n Urns draw Light,<br/>
And hence the Morning Planet guilds his horns;<br/>
By tincture or reflection they augment<br/>
Thir small peculiar, though from human sight<br/>
So farr remote, with diminution seen.<br/>
First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen,<br/>
Regent of Day, and all th’ Horizon round<br/>
Invested with bright Rayes, jocond to run<br/>
His Longitude through Heav’ns high rode: the gray<br/>
Dawn, and the <i>Pleiades</i> before him danc’d<br/>
Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon,<br/>
But opposite in leveld West was set<br/>
His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light<br/>
From him, for other light she needed none<br/>
In that aspect, and still that distance keepes<br/>
Till night, then in the East her turn she shines,<br/>
Revolvd on Heav’ns great Axle, and her Reign<br/>
With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds,<br/>
With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer’d<br/>
Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd<br/>
With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose,<br/>
Glad Eevning &amp; glad Morn crownd the fourth day.<br/>

And God said, let the Waters generate<br/>

The waters generated by thir kindes,<br/>

Or in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend<br/>

Thir callow young, but featherd soon and fledge<br/>
They summ’d thir Penns, and soaring th’ air sublime<br/>
With clang despis’d the ground, under a cloud<br/>
In prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork<br/>
On Cliffs and Cedar tops thir Eyries build:<br/>
Part loosly wing the Region, part more wise<br/>
In common, rang’d in figure wedge thir way,<br/>
Intelligent of seasons, and set forth<br/>
Thir Aierie Caravan high over Sea’s<br/>
Flying, and over Lands with mutual wing<br/>
Easing thir flight; so stears the prudent Crane<br/>
Her annual Voiage, born on Windes; the Aire<br/>
Floats, as they pass, fann’d with unnumber’d plumes:<br/>
From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song<br/>
Solac’d the Woods, and spred thir painted wings<br/>
Till Ev’n, nor then the solemn Nightingal<br/>
Ceas’d warbling, but all night tun’d her soft layes:<br/>
Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bath’d<br/>
Thir downie Brest; the Swan with Arched neck<br/>
Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rowes<br/>
Her state with Oarie feet: yet oft they quit<br/>
The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, towre<br/>
The mid Aereal Skie: Others on ground<br/>
Walk’d firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds<br/>
The silent hours, and th’ other whose gay Traine<br/>
Adorns him, colour’d with the Florid hue<br/>
Of Rainbows and Starrie Eyes.  The Waters thus<br/>

The Sixt, and of Creation last arose<br/>
With Eevning Harps and Mattin, when God said,<br/>
Let th’ Earth bring forth Fowle living in her kinde,<br/>
Cattel and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth,<br/>
Each in their kinde.  The Earth obey’d, and strait<br/>
Op’ning her fertil Woomb teem’d at a Birth<br/>
Innumerous living Creatures, perfet formes,<br/>
Limb’d and full grown: out of the ground up-rose<br/>
As from his Laire the wilde Beast where he wonns<br/>
In Forrest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den;<br/>
Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walk’d:<br/>
The Cattel in the Fields and Meddowes green:<br/>
Those rare and solitarie, these in flocks<br/>
Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung:<br/>
The grassie Clods now Calv’d, now half appeer’d<br/>
The Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free<br/>
His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds,<br/>
And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce,<br/>
The Libbard, and the Tyger, as the Moale<br/>
Rising, the crumbl’d Earth above them threw<br/>
In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground<br/>
Bore up his branching head: scarse from his mould<br/>
<i>Behemoth</i> biggest born of Earth upheav’d<br/>
His vastness: Fleec’t the Flocks and bleating rose,<br/>
As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land<br/>
The River Horse and scalie Crocodile.<br/>
At once came forth whatever creeps the ground,<br/>
Insect or Worme; those wav’d thir limber fans<br/>
For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact<br/>
In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride<br/>
With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green:<br/>
These as a line thir long dimension drew,<br/>
Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all<br/>
Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kinde<br/>
Wondrous in length and corpulence involv’d<br/>
Thir Snakie foulds, and added wings.  First crept<br/>
The Parsimonious Emmet, provident<br/>
Of future, in small room large heart enclos’d,<br/>
Pattern of just equalitie perhaps<br/>
Hereafter, join’d in her popular Tribes<br/>
Of Commonaltie: swarming next appeer’d<br/>
The Femal Bee that feeds her Husband Drone<br/>
Deliciously, and builds her waxen Cells<br/>
With Honey stor’d: the rest are numberless,<br/>
And thou thir Natures know’st, and gav’st them Names,<br/>
Needlest to thee repeaed; nor unknown<br/>
The Serpent suttl’st Beast of all the field,<br/>
Of huge extent somtimes, with brazen Eyes<br/>
And hairie Main terrific, though to thee<br/>
Not noxious, but obedient at thy call.<br/>
Now Heav’n in all her Glorie shon, and rowld<br/>
Her motions, as the great first-Movers hand<br/>
First wheeld thir course; Earth in her rich attire<br/>
Consummate lovly smil’d; Aire, Water, Earth,<br/>
By Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walkt<br/>
Frequent; and of the Sixt day yet remain’d;<br/>
There wanted yet the Master work, the end<br/>
Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone<br/>
And Brute as other Creatures, but endu’d<br/>
With Sanctitie of Reason, might erect<br/>
His Stature, and upright with Front serene<br/>
Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence<br/>
Magnanimous to correspond with Heav’n,<br/>
But grateful to acknowledge whence his good<br/>
Descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes<br/>
Directed in Devotion, to adore<br/>
And worship God Supream, who made him chief<br/>
Of all his works: therefore the Omnipotent<br/>
Eternal Father (For where is not hee<br/>
Present) thus to his Son audibly spake.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Let us make now Man in our image, Man<br/>
In our similitude, and let them rule<br/>
Over the Fish and Fowle of Sea and Aire,<br/>
Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth,<br/>
And every creeping thing that creeps the ground.<br/>
This said, he formd thee, <i>Adam</i>, thee O Man<br/>
Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breath’d<br/>
The breath of Life; in his own Image hee<br/>
Created thee, in the Image of God<br/>
Express, and thou becam’st a living Soul.<br/>
Male he created thee, but thy consort<br/>
Femal for Race; then bless’d Mankinde, and said,<br/>
Be fruitful, multiplie, and fill the Earth,<br/>
Subdue it, and throughout Dominion hold<br/>
Over Fish of the Sea, and Fowle of the Aire,<br/>
And every living thing that moves on the Earth.<br/>
Wherever thus created, for no place<br/>
Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou know’st<br/>
He brought thee into this delicious Grove,<br/>
This Garden, planted with the Trees of God,<br/>
Delectable both to behold and taste;<br/>
And freely all thir pleasant fruit for food<br/>
Gave thee, all sorts are here that all th’ Earth yeelds,<br/>
Varietie without end; but of the Tree<br/>
Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil,<br/>
Thou mai’st not; in the day thou eat’st, thou di’st;<br/>
Death is the penaltie impos’d, beware,<br/>
And govern well thy appetite, least sin<br/>
Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death.<br/>
Here finish’d hee, and all that he had made<br/>
View’d, and behold all was entirely good;<br/>
So Ev’n and Morn accomplish’d the Sixt day:<br/>
Yet not till the Creator from his work<br/>
Desisting, though unwearied, up returnd<br/>
Up to the Heav’n of Heav’ns his high abode,<br/>
Thence to behold this new created World<br/>
Th’ addition of his Empire, how it shew’d<br/>
In prospect from his Throne, how good, how faire,<br/>
Answering his great Idea.  Up he rode<br/>
Followd with acclamation and the sound<br/>
Symphonious of ten thousand Harpes that tun’d<br/>
Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Aire<br/>
Resounded, (thou remember’st, for thou heardst)<br/>
The Heav’ns and all the Constellations rung,<br/>
The Planets in thir stations list’ning stood,<br/>
While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant.<br/>
Open, ye everlasting Gates, they sung,<br/>
Open, ye Heav’ns, your living dores; let in<br/>
The great Creator from his work returnd<br/>
Magnificent, his Six days work, a World;<br/>
Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deigne<br/>
To visit oft the dwellings of just Men<br/>
Delighted, and with frequent intercourse<br/>
Thither will send his winged Messengers<br/>
On errands of supernal Grace.  So sung<br/>
The glorious Train ascending: He through Heav’n,<br/>
That open’d wide her blazing Portals, led<br/>
To Gods Eternal house direct the way,<br/>
A broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold<br/>
And pavement Starrs, as Starrs to thee appeer,<br/>
Seen in the Galaxie, that Milkie way<br/>
Which nightly as a circling Zone thou seest<br/>
Pouderd with Starrs.  And now on Earth the Seaventh<br/>
Eev’ning arose in <i>Eden</i>, for the Sun<br/>
Was set, and twilight from the East came on,<br/>
Forerunning Night; when at the holy mount<br/>
Of Heav’ns high-seated top, th’ Impereal Throne<br/>
Of Godhead, fixt for ever firm and sure,<br/>
The Filial Power arriv’d, and sate him down<br/>
With his great Father (for he also went<br/>
Invisible, yet staid (such priviledge<br/>
Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordain’d,<br/>
Author and end of all things, and from work<br/>
Now resting, bless’d and hallowd the Seav’nth day,<br/>
As resting on that day from all his work,<br/>
But not in silence holy kept; the Harp<br/>
Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe,<br/>
And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop,<br/>
All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire<br/>
Temper’d soft Tunings, intermixt with Voice<br/>
Choral or Unison: of incense Clouds<br/>
Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount.<br/>
Creation and the Six dayes acts they sung,<br/>
Great are thy works, <i>Jehovah</i>, infinite<br/>
Thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue<br/>
Relate thee; greater now in thy return<br/>
Then from the Giant Angels; thee that day<br/>
Thy Thunders magnifi’d; but to create<br/>
Is greater then created to destroy.<br/>
Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound<br/>
Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt<br/>
Of Spirits apostat and thir Counsels vaine<br/>
Thou hast repeld, while impiously they thought<br/>
Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw<br/>
The number of thy worshippers.  Who seekes<br/>
To lessen thee, against his purpose serves<br/>
To manifest the more thy might: his evil<br/>
Thou usest, and from thence creat’st more good.<br/>
Witness this new-made World, another Heav’n<br/>
From Heaven Gate not farr, founded in view<br/>
On the cleer <i>Hyaline</i>, the Glassie Sea;<br/>
Of amplitude almost immense, with Starr’s<br/>
Numerous, and every Starr perhaps a World<br/>
Of destind habitation; but thou know’st<br/>
Thir seasons: among these the seat of men,<br/>
Earth with her nether Ocean circumfus’d,<br/>
Thir pleasant dwelling place.  Thrice happie men,<br/>
And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanc’t,<br/>
Created in his Image, there to dwell<br/>
And worship him, and in reward to rule<br/>
Over his Works, on Earth, in Sea, or Air,<br/>
And multiply a Race of Worshippers<br/>
Holy and just: thrice happie if they know<br/>
Thir happiness, and persevere upright.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So sung they, and the Empyrean rung,<br/>
With <i>Halleluiahs</i>: Thus was Sabbath kept.<br/>
And thy request think now fulfill’d, that ask’d<br/>
How first this World and face of things began,<br/>
And what before thy memorie was don<br/>
From the beginning, that posteritie<br/>
Informd by thee might know; if else thou seekst<br/>
Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.<br/>

So spake our Sire, and by his count’nance seemd<br/>

Chose rather; hee, she knew would intermix<br/>
Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute<br/>
With conjugal Caresses, from his Lip<br/>
Not Words alone pleas’d her.  O when meet now<br/>
Such pairs, in Love and mutual Honour joyn’d?<br/>
With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went;<br/>
Not unattended, for on her as Queen<br/>
A pomp of winning Graces waited still,<br/>
And from about her shot Darts of desire<br/>
Into all Eyes to wish her still in sight.<br/>
And <i>Raphael</i> now to <i>Adam</i>’s doubt propos’d<br/>
Benevolent and facil thus repli’d.<br/>

<p class="poem">
To ask or search I blame thee not, for Heav’n<br/>
Is as the Book of God before thee set,<br/>
Wherein to read his wondrous Works, and learne<br/>
His Seasons, Hours, or Days, or Months, or Yeares:<br/>
This to attain, whether Heav’n move or Earth,<br/>
Imports not, if thou reck’n right, the rest<br/>
From Man or Angel the great Architect<br/>
Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge<br/>
His secrets to be scann’d by them who ought<br/>
Rather admire; or if they list to try<br/>
Conjecture, he his Fabric of the Heav’ns<br/>
Hath left to thir disputes, perhaps to move<br/>
His laughter at thir quaint Opinions wide<br/>
Hereafter, when they come to model Heav’n<br/>
And calculate the Starrs, how they will weild<br/>
The mightie frame, how build, unbuild, contrive<br/>
To save appeerances, how gird the Sphear<br/>
With Centric and Eccentric scribl’d o’re,<br/>
Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb:<br/>
Alreadie by thy reasoning this I guess,<br/>
Who art to lead thy ofspring, and supposest<br/>
That Bodies bright and greater should not serve<br/>
The less not bright, nor Heav’n such journies run,<br/>
Earth sitting still, when she alone receaves<br/>
The benefit: consider first, that Great<br/>
Or Bright inferrs not Excellence: the Earth<br/>
Though, in comparison of Heav’n, so small,<br/>
Nor glistering, may of solid good containe<br/>
More plenty then the Sun that barren shines,<br/>
Whose vertue on it self workes no effect,<br/>
But in the fruitful Earth; there first receavd<br/>
His beams, unactive else, thir vigor find.<br/>
Yet not to Earth are those bright Luminaries<br/>
Officious, but to thee Earths habitant.<br/>
And for the Heav’ns wide Circuit, let it speak<br/>
The Makers high magnificence, who built<br/>
So spacious, and his Line stretcht out so farr;<br/>
That Man may know he dwells not in his own;<br/>
An Edifice too large for him to fill,<br/>
Lodg’d in a small partition, and the rest<br/>
Ordain’d for uses to his Lord best known.<br/>
The swiftness of those Circles attribute,<br/>
Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,<br/>
That to corporeal substances could adde<br/>
Speed almost Spiritual; mee thou thinkst not slow,<br/>
Who since the Morning hour set out from Heav’n<br/>
Where God resides, and ere mid-day arriv’d<br/>
In <i>Eden</i>, distance inexpressible<br/>
By Numbers that have name.  But this I urge,<br/>
Admitting Motion in the Heav’ns, to shew<br/>
Invalid that which thee to doubt it mov’d;<br/>
Not that I so affirm, though so it seem<br/>
To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.<br/>
God to remove his wayes from human sense,<br/>
Plac’d Heav’n from Earth so farr, that earthly sight,<br/>
If it presume, might erre in things too high,<br/>
And no advantage gaine.  What if the Sun<br/>
Be Center to the World, and other Starrs<br/>
By his attractive vertue and thir own<br/>
Incited, dance about him various rounds?<br/>
Thir wandring course now high, now low, then hid,<br/>
Progressive, retrograde, or standing still,<br/>
In six thou seest, and what if sev’nth to these<br/>
The Planet Earth, so stedfast though she seem,<br/>
Insensibly three different Motions move?<br/>
Which else to several Sphears thou must ascribe,<br/>
Mov’d contrarie with thwart obliquities,<br/>
Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift<br/>
Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb suppos’d,<br/>
Invisible else above all Starrs, the Wheele<br/>
Of Day and Night; which needs not thy beleefe,<br/>
If Earth industrious of her self fetch Day<br/>
Travelling East, and with her part averse<br/>
From the Suns beam meet Night, her other part<br/>
Still luminous by his ray.  What if that light<br/>
Sent from her through the wide transpicuous aire,<br/>
To the terrestrial Moon be as a Starr<br/>
Enlightning her by Day, as she by Night<br/>
This Earth? reciprocal, if Land be there,<br/>
Feilds and Inhabitants: Her spots thou seest<br/>
As Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain produce<br/>
Fruits in her soft’nd Soile, for some to eate<br/>
Allotted there; and other Suns perhaps<br/>
With thir attendant Moons thou wilt descrie<br/>
Communicating Male and Femal Light,<br/>
Which two great Sexes animate the World,<br/>
Stor’d in each Orb perhaps with some that live.<br/>
For such vast room in Nature unpossest<br/>
By living Soule, desert and desolate,<br/>
Onely to shine, yet scarce to contribute<br/>
Each Orb a glimps of Light, conveyd so farr<br/>
Down to this habitable, which returnes<br/>
Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.<br/>
But whether thus these things, or whether not,<br/>
Whether the Sun predominant in Heav’n<br/>
Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun,<br/>
Hee from the East his flaming rode begin,<br/>
Or Shee from West her silent course advance<br/>
With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps<br/>
On her soft Axle, while she paces Eev’n,<br/>
And bears thee soft with the smooth Air along,<br/>
Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid,<br/>
Leave them to God above, him serve and feare;<br/>
Of other Creatures, as him pleases best,<br/>
Wherever plac’t, let him dispose: joy thou<br/>
In what he gives to thee, this Paradise<br/>
And thy faire <i>Eve</i>; Heav’n is for thee too high<br/>
To know what passes there; be lowlie wise:<br/>
Think onely what concernes thee and thy being;<br/>
Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures there<br/>
Live, in what state, condition or degree,<br/>
Contented that thus farr hath been reveal’d<br/>
Not of Earth onely but of highest Heav’n.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
To whom thus <i>Adam</i> cleerd of doubt, repli’d.<br/>
How fully hast thou satisfi’d mee, pure<br/>
Intelligence of Heav’n, Angel serene,<br/>
And freed from intricacies, taught to live,<br/>
The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts<br/>
To interrupt the sweet of Life, from which<br/>
God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares,<br/>
And not molest us, unless we our selves<br/>
Seek them with wandring thoughts, and notions vaine.<br/>
But apt the Mind or Fancie is to roave<br/>
Uncheckt, and of her roaving is no end;<br/>
Till warn’d, or by experience taught, she learne,<br/>
That not to know at large of things remote<br/>
From use, obscure and suttle, but to know<br/>
That which before us lies in daily life,<br/>
Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume,<br/>
Or emptiness, or fond impertinence,<br/>
And renders us in things that most concerne<br/>
Unpractis’d, unprepar’d, and still to seek.<br/>
Therefore from this high pitch let us descend<br/>
A lower flight, and speak of things at hand<br/>
Useful, whence haply mention may arise<br/>
Of somthing not unseasonable to ask<br/>
By sufferance, and thy wonted favour deign’d.<br/>
Thee I have heard relating what was don<br/>
Ere my remembrance: now hear mee relate<br/>
My Storie, which perhaps thou hast not heard;<br/>
And Day is yet not spent; till then thou seest<br/>
How suttly to detaine thee I devise,<br/>
Inviting thee to hear while I relate,<br/>
Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply:<br/>
For while I sit with thee, I seem in Heav’n,<br/>
And sweeter thy discourse is to my eare<br/>
Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst<br/>
And hunger both, from labour, at the houre<br/>
Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill,<br/>
Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace Divine<br/>
Imbu’d, bring to thir sweetness no satietie.<br/>

To whom thus <i>Raphael</i> answer’d heav’nly meek.<br/>
Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men,<br/>

Abundantly his gifts hath also pour’d,<br/>
Inward and outward both, his image faire:<br/>
Speaking or mute all comliness and grace<br/>
Attends thee, and each word, each motion formes.<br/>
Nor less think wee in Heav’n of thee on Earth<br/>
Then of our fellow servant, and inquire<br/>
Gladly into the wayes of God with Man:<br/>
For God we see hath honour’d thee, and set<br/>
On Man his equal Love: say therefore on;<br/>
For I that Day was absent, as befell,<br/>
Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure,<br/>
Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell;<br/>
Squar’d in full Legion (such command we had)<br/>
To see that none thence issu’d forth a spie,<br/>
Or enemie, while God was in his work,<br/>
Least hee incenst at such eruption bold,<br/>
Destruction with Creation might have mixt.<br/>
Not that they durst without his leave attempt,<br/>
But us he sends upon his high behests<br/>
For state, as Sovran King, and to enure<br/>
Our prompt obedience.  Fast we found, fast shut<br/>
The dismal Gates, and barricado’d strong;<br/>
But long ere our approaching heard within<br/>
Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song,<br/>
Torment, and lowd lament, and furious rage.<br/>
Glad we return’d up to the coasts of Light<br/>
Ere Sabbath Eev’ning: so we had in charge.<br/>
But thy relation now; for I attend,<br/>
Pleas’d with thy words no less then thou with mine.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire.<br/>
For Man to tell how human Life began<br/>
Is hard; for who himself beginning knew?<br/>
Desire with thee still longer to converse<br/>
Induc’d me.  As new wak’t from soundest sleep<br/>
Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid<br/>
In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun<br/>
Soon dri’d, and on the reaking moisture fed.<br/>
Strait toward Heav’n my wondring Eyes I turnd,<br/>
And gaz’d a while the ample Skie, till rais’d<br/>
By quick instinctive motion up I sprung,<br/>
As thitherward endevoring, and upright<br/>
Stood on my feet; about me round I saw<br/>
Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines,<br/>
And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these,<br/>
Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk’d, or flew,<br/>
Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil’d,<br/>
With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow’d.<br/>
My self I then perus’d, and Limb by Limb<br/>
Survey’d, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran<br/>
With supple joints, as lively vigour led:<br/>
But who I was, or where, or from what cause,<br/>
Knew not; to speak I tri’d, and forthwith spake,<br/>
My Tongue obey’d and readily could name<br/>
What e’re I saw.  Thou Sun, said I, faire Light,<br/>
And thou enlight’nd Earth, so fresh and gay,<br/>
Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines,<br/>
And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell,<br/>
Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here?<br/>
Not of my self; by some great Maker then,<br/>
In goodness and in power praeeminent;<br/>
Tell me, how may I know him, how adore,<br/>
From whom I have that thus I move and live,<br/>
And feel that I am happier then I know.<br/>
While thus I call’d, and stray’d I knew not whither,<br/>
From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld<br/>
This happie Light, when answer none return’d,<br/>
On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours<br/>
Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep<br/>
First found me, and with soft oppression seis’d<br/>
My droused sense, untroubl’d, though I thought<br/>
I then was passing to my former state<br/>
Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve:<br/>
When suddenly stood at my Head a dream,<br/>
Whose inward apparition gently mov’d<br/>
My Fancy to believe I yet had being,<br/>
And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine,<br/>
And said, thy Mansion wants thee, <i>Adam</i>, rise,<br/>
First Man, of Men innumerable ordain’d<br/>
First Father, call’d by thee I come thy Guide<br/>
To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar’d.<br/>
So saying, by the hand he took me rais’d,<br/>
And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire<br/>
Smooth sliding without step, last led me up<br/>
A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine,<br/>
A Circuit wide, enclos’d, with goodliest Trees<br/>
Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw<br/>
Of Earth before scarse pleasant seemd.  Each Tree<br/>
Load’n with fairest Fruit, that hung to the Eye<br/>
Tempting, stirr’d in me sudden appetite<br/>
To pluck and eate; whereat I wak’d, and found<br/>
Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream<br/>
Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun<br/>
My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide<br/>
Up hither, from among the Trees appeer’d,<br/>
Presence Divine.  Rejoycing, but with aw<br/>
In adoration at his feet I fell<br/>
Submiss: he rear’d me, &amp; Whom thou soughtst I am,<br/>
Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest<br/>
Above, or round about thee or beneath.<br/>
This Paradise I give thee, count it thine<br/>
To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate:<br/>
Of every Tree that in the Garden growes<br/>
Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth:<br/>
But of the Tree whose operation brings<br/>
Knowledg of good and ill, which I have set<br/>
The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith,<br/>
Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life,<br/>
Remember what I warne thee, shun to taste,<br/>
And shun the bitter consequence: for know,<br/>
The day thou eat’st thereof, my sole command<br/>
Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye;<br/>
From that day mortal, and this happie State<br/>
Shalt loose, expell’d from hence into a World<br/>
Of woe and sorrow.  Sternly he pronounc’d<br/>
The rigid interdiction, which resounds<br/>
Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice<br/>
Not to incur; but soon his cleer aspect<br/>
Return’d and gratious purpose thus renew’d.<br/>
Not onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth<br/>
To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords<br/>
Possess it, and all things that therein live,<br/>
Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle.<br/>
In signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold<br/>
After thir kindes; I bring them to receave<br/>
From thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtie<br/>
With low subjection; understand the same<br/>
Of Fish within thir watry residence,<br/>
Not hither summond, since they cannot change<br/>
Thir Element to draw the thinner Aire.<br/>
As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold<br/>
Approaching two and two, These cowring low<br/>
With blandishment, each Bird stoop’d on his wing.<br/>
I nam’d them, as they pass’d, and understood<br/>
Thir Nature, with such knowledg God endu’d<br/>
My sudden apprehension: but in these<br/>
I found not what me thought I wanted still;<br/>
And to the Heav’nly vision thus presum’d.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O by what Name, for thou above all these,<br/>
Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher,<br/>

Adore thee, Author of this Universe,<br/>
And all this good to man, for whose well being<br/>
So amply, and with hands so liberal<br/>
Thou hast provided all things: but with mee<br/>
I see not who partakes.  In solitude<br/>
What happiness, who can enjoy alone,<br/>
Or all enjoying, what contentment find?<br/>
Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright,<br/>
As with a smile more bright’nd, thus repli’d.<br/>

And reason not contemptibly; with these<br/>
Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large.<br/>

So ordering.  I with leave of speech implor’d,<br/>

Can sort, what harmonie or true delight?<br/>
Which must be mutual, in proportion due<br/>
Giv’n and receiv’d; but in disparitie<br/>
The one intense, the other still remiss<br/>
Cannot well suite with either, but soon prove<br/>
Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak<br/>
Such as I seek, fit to participate<br/>
All rational delight, wherein the brute<br/>
Cannot be human consort; they rejoyce<br/>
Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness;<br/>
So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin’d;<br/>
Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle<br/>
So well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape;<br/>

No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie.<br/>

Dazl’d and spent, sunk down, and sought repair<br/>
Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, call’d<br/>

Mine eyes he clos’d, but op’n left the Cell<br/>
Of Fancie my internal sight, by which<br/>
Abstract as in a transe methought I saw,<br/>
Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape<br/>
Still glorious before whom awake I stood;<br/>
Who stooping op’nd my left side, and took<br/>
From thence a Rib, with cordial spirits warme,<br/>
And Life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound,<br/>
But suddenly with flesh fill’d up &amp; heal’d:<br/>

Under his forming hands a Creature grew,<br/>

And in her looks, which from that time infus’d<br/>
Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before,<br/>

The spirit of love and amorous delight.<br/>
She disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak’d<br/>

When out of hope, behold her, not farr off,<br/>
Such as I saw her in my dream, adornd<br/>
With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow<br/>
To make her amiable: On she came,<br/>
Led by her Heav’nly Maker, though unseen,<br/>

Sung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning Starr<br/>

Farr otherwise, transported I behold,<br/>
Transported touch; here passion first I felt,<br/>
Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else<br/>
Superiour and unmov’d, here onely weake<br/>
Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance.<br/>
Or Nature faild in mee, and left some part<br/>
Not proof enough such Object to sustain,<br/>
Or from my side subducting, took perhaps<br/>
More then enough; at least on her bestow’d<br/>
Too much of Ornament, in outward shew<br/>
Elaborate, of inward less exact.<br/>
For well I understand in the prime end<br/>
Of Nature her th’ inferiour, in the mind<br/>
And inward Faculties, which most excell,<br/>
In outward also her resembling less<br/>
His Image who made both, and less expressing<br/>
The character of that Dominion giv’n<br/>
O’re other Creatures; yet when I approach<br/>
Her loveliness, so absolute she seems<br/>
And in her self compleat, so well to know<br/>
Her own, that what she wills to do or say,<br/>
Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best;<br/>
All higher knowledge in her presence falls<br/>
Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with her<br/>

To them made common &amp; divulg’d, if aught<br/>
Therein enjoy’d were worthy to subdue<br/>
The Soule of Man, or passion in him move.<br/>
What higher in her societie thou findst<br/>
Attractive, human, rational, love still;<br/>
In loving thou dost well, in passion not,<br/>
Wherein true Love consists not; love refines<br/>
The thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his seat<br/>
In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale<br/>
By which to heav’nly Love thou maist ascend,<br/>
Not sunk in carnal pleasure, for which cause<br/>
Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was found.<br/>

To whom thus half abash’t <i>Adam</i> repli’d.<br/>

And with mysterious reverence I deem)<br/>
So much delights me, as those graceful acts,<br/>
Those thousand decencies that daily flow<br/>
From all her words and actions, mixt with Love<br/>
And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign’d<br/>
Union of Mind, or in us both one Soule;<br/>
Harmonie to behold in wedded pair<br/>
More grateful then harmonious sound to the eare.<br/>
Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose<br/>
What inward thence I feel, not therefore foild,<br/>
Who meet with various objects, from the sense<br/>
Variously representing; yet still free<br/>
Approve the best, and follow what I approve.<br/>
To love thou blam’st me not, for love thou saist<br/>
Leads up to Heav’n, is both the way and guide;<br/>
Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask;<br/>
Love not the heav’nly Spirits, and how thir Love<br/>
Express they, by looks onely, or do they mix<br/>

To whom the Angel with a smile that glow’d<br/>

In eminence, and obstacle find none<br/>

Easier then Air with Air, if Spirits embrace,<br/>

Be strong, live happie, and love, but first of all<br/>
Him whom to love is to obey, and keep<br/>

<span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>o more of talk where God or Angel Guest<br/>
With Man, as with his Friend, familiar us’d<br/>

Those Notes to Tragic; foul distrust, and breach<br/>
Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt<br/>
And disobedience: On the part of Heav’n<br/>
Now alienated, distance and distaste,<br/>
Anger and just rebuke, and judgement giv’n,<br/>
That brought into this World a world of woe,<br/>
Sinne and her shadow Death, and Miserie<br/>
Deaths Harbinger: Sad task, yet argument<br/>
Not less but more Heroic then the wrauth<br/>

Thrice Fugitive about <i>Troy</i> Wall; or rage<br/>
Of <i>Turnus</i> for <i>Lavinia</i> disespous’d,<br/>

Since first this subject for Heroic Song<br/>
Pleas’d me long choosing, and beginning late;<br/>
Not sedulous by Nature to indite<br/>
Warrs, hitherto the onely Argument<br/>
Heroic deem’d, chief maistrie to dissect<br/>
With long and tedious havoc fabl’d Knights<br/>
In Battels feign’d; the better fortitude<br/>
Of Patience and Heroic Martyrdom<br/>

<p class="poem">
The Sun was sunk, and after him the Starr<br/>
Of <i>Hesperus</i>, whose Office is to bring<br/>
Twilight upon the Earth, short Arbiter<br/>
Twixt Day and Night, and now from end to end<br/>
Nights Hemisphere had veild the Horizon round:<br/>
When <i>Satan</i> who late fled before the threats<br/>
Of <i>Gabriel</i> out of <i>Eden</i>, now improv’d<br/>
In meditated fraud and malice, bent<br/>
On mans destruction, maugre what might hap<br/>
Of heavier on himself, fearless return’d.<br/>
By Night he fled, and at Midnight return’d<br/>
From compassing the Earth, cautious of day,<br/>
Since <i>Uriel</i> Regent of the Sun descri’d<br/>
His entrance, and forewarnd the Cherubim<br/>
That kept thir watch; thence full of anguish driv’n,<br/>
The space of seven continu’d Nights he rode<br/>
With darkness, thrice the Equinoctial Line<br/>
He circl’d, four times cross’d the Carr of Night<br/>
From Pole to Pole, traversing each Colure;<br/>
On the eighth return’d, and on the Coast averse<br/>
From entrance or Cherubic Watch, by stealth<br/>
Found unsuspected way.  There was a place,<br/>
Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change,<br/>
Where <i>Tigris</i> at the foot of Paradise<br/>
Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part<br/>
Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life;<br/>
In with the River sunk, and with it rose<br/>
Satan involv’d in rising Mist, then sought<br/>
Where to lie hid; Sea he had searcht and Land<br/>
From <i>Eden</i> over <i>Pontus</i>, and the Poole<br/>
<i>Maeotis</i>, up beyond the River <i>Ob</i>;<br/>
Downward as farr Antartic; and in length<br/>
West from <i>Orantes</i> to the Ocean barr’d<br/>
At <i>Darien</i>, thence to the Land where flowes<br/>
<i>Ganges</i> and <i>Indus:</i> thus the Orb he roam’d<br/>
With narrow search; and with inspection deep<br/>
Consider’d every Creature, which of all<br/>
Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found<br/>
The Serpent suttlest Beast of all the Field.<br/>
Him after long debate, irresolute<br/>
Of thoughts revolv’d, his final sentence chose<br/>
Fit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom<br/>
To enter, and his dark suggestions hide<br/>
From sharpest sight: for in the wilie Snake,<br/>
Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark,<br/>
As from his wit and native suttletie<br/>
Proceeding, which in other Beasts observ’d<br/>
Doubt might beget of Diabolic pow’r<br/>
Active within beyond the sense of brute.<br/>
Thus he resolv’d, but first from inward griefe<br/>
His bursting passion into plaints thus pour’d:<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O Earth, how like to Heav’n, if not preferrd<br/>
More justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built<br/>
With second thoughts, reforming what was old!<br/>
For what God after better worse would build?<br/>
Terrestrial Heav’n, danc’t round by other Heav’ns<br/>
That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps,<br/>
Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems,<br/>
In thee concentring all thir precious beams<br/>
Of sacred influence: As God in Heav’n<br/>
Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou<br/>
Centring receav’st from all those Orbs; in thee,<br/>
Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers<br/>
Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth<br/>
Of Creatures animate with gradual life<br/>
Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ’d up in Man.<br/>
With what delight could I have walkt thee round<br/>
If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange<br/>
Of Hill and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines,<br/>
Now Land, now Sea, &amp; Shores with Forrest crownd,<br/>
Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these<br/>
Find place or refuge; and the more I see<br/>
Pleasures about me, so much more I feel<br/>
Torment within me, as from the hateful siege<br/>
Of contraries; all good to me becomes<br/>
Bane, and in Heav’n much worse would be my state.<br/>
But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav’n<br/>
To dwell, unless by maistring Heav’ns Supreame;<br/>
Nor hope to be my self less miserable<br/>
By what I seek, but others to make such<br/>
As I though thereby worse to me redound:<br/>
For onely in destroying I finde ease<br/>
To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd,<br/>
Or won to what may work his utter loss,<br/>
For whom all this was made, all this will soon<br/>
Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe,<br/>
In wo then; that destruction wide may range:<br/>
To mee shall be the glorie sole among<br/>
The infernal Powers, in one day to have marr’d<br/>
What he <i>Almightie</i> styl’d, six Nights and Days<br/>
Continu’d making, and who knows how long<br/>
Before had bin contriving, though perhaps<br/>
Not longer then since I in one Night freed<br/>
From servitude inglorious welnigh half<br/>
Th’ Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng<br/>
Of his adorers: hee to be aveng’d,<br/>
And to repaire his numbers thus impair’d,<br/>
Whether such vertue spent of old now faild<br/>
More Angels to Create, if they at least<br/>
Are his Created or to spite us more,<br/>
Determin’d to advance into our room<br/>
A Creature form’d of Earth, and him endow,<br/>
Exalted from so base original,<br/>
With Heav’nly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed<br/>
He effected; Man he made, and for him built<br/>
Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat,<br/>
Him Lord pronounc’d, and, O indignitie!<br/>
Subjected to his service Angel wings,<br/>
And flaming Ministers to watch and tend<br/>
Thir earthlie Charge: Of these the vigilance<br/>
I dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist<br/>
Of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie<br/>
In every Bush and Brake, where hap may finde<br/>
The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds<br/>
To hide me, and the dark intent I bring.<br/>
O foul descent! that I who erst contended<br/>
With Gods to sit the highest, am now constraind<br/>
Into a Beast, and mixt with bestial slime,<br/>
This essence to incarnate and imbrute,<br/>
That to the hight of Deitie aspir’d;<br/>
But what will not Ambition and Revenge<br/>
Descend to? who aspires must down as low<br/>
As high he soard, obnoxious first or last<br/>
To basest things.  Revenge, at first though sweet,<br/>
Bitter ere long back on it self recoiles;<br/>
Let it; I reck not, so it light well aim’d,<br/>
Since higher I fall short, on him who next<br/>
Provokes my envie, this new Favorite<br/>
Of Heav’n, this Man of Clay, Son of despite,<br/>
Whom us the more to spite his Maker rais’d<br/>
From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Drie,<br/>
Like a black mist low creeping, he held on<br/>
His midnight search, where soonest he might finde<br/>
The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found<br/>
In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowl’d,<br/>
His head the midst, well stor’d with suttle wiles:<br/>
Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den,<br/>
Not nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe<br/>
Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth<br/>
The Devil enterd, and his brutal sense,<br/>
In heart or head, possessing soon inspir’d<br/>
With act intelligential; but his sleep<br/>
Disturbd not, waiting close th’ approach of Morn.<br/>
Now whenas sacred Light began to dawne<br/>
In <i>Eden</i> on the humid Flours, that breathd<br/>
Thir morning Incense, when all things that breath,<br/>
From th’ Earths great Altar send up silent praise<br/>
To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill<br/>
With gratefull Smell, forth came the human pair<br/>
And joynd thir vocal Worship to the Quire<br/>
Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake<br/>
The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires:<br/>
Then commune how that day they best may ply<br/>
Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew<br/>
The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide.<br/>
And <i>Eve</i> first to her Husband thus began.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
<i>Adam</i>, well may we labour still to dress<br/>
This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour.<br/>
Our pleasant task enjoyn’d, but till more hands<br/>
Aid us, the work under our labour grows,<br/>
Luxurious by restraint; what we by day<br/>
Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind,<br/>
One night or two with wanton growth derides<br/>
Tending to wilde.  Thou therefore now advise<br/>
Or hear what to my mind first thoughts present,<br/>
Let us divide our labours, thou where choice<br/>
Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind<br/>
The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct<br/>
The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I<br/>
In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt<br/>
With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon:<br/>
For while so near each other thus all day<br/>
Our task we choose, what wonder if no near<br/>
Looks intervene and smiles, or object new<br/>
Casual discourse draw on, which intermits<br/>
Our dayes work brought to little, though begun<br/>
Early, and th’ hour of Supper comes unearn’d.<br/>

<p class="poem">
To whom mild answer <i>Adam</i> thus return’d.<br/>
Sole <i>Eve</i>, Associate sole, to me beyond<br/>
Compare above all living Creatures deare,<br/>
Well hast thou motion’d, wel thy thoughts imployd<br/>
How we might best fulfill the work which here<br/>
God hath assign’d us, nor of me shalt pass<br/>
Unprais’d: for nothing lovelier can be found<br/>
In woman, then to studie houshold good,<br/>
And good workes in her Husband to promote.<br/>
Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos’d<br/>
Labour, as to debarr us when we need<br/>
Refreshment, whether food, or talk between,<br/>
Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse<br/>
Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow,<br/>
To brute deni’d, and are of Love the food,<br/>
Love not the lowest end of human life.<br/>
For not to irksom toile, but to delight<br/>
He made us, and delight to Reason joyn’d.<br/>
These paths and Bowers doubt not but our joynt<br/>
Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide<br/>
As we need walk, till younger hands ere long<br/>
Assist us: But if much converse perhaps<br/>
Thee satiate, to short absence I could yeild.<br/>
For solitude somtimes is best societie,<br/>
And short retirement urges sweet returne.<br/>
But other doubt possesses me, least harm<br/>
Befall thee sever’d from me; for thou knowst<br/>
What hath bin warn’d us, what malicious Foe<br/>
Envying our happiness, and of his own<br/>
Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame<br/>
By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand<br/>
Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find<br/>
His wish and best advantage, us asunder,<br/>
Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each<br/>
To other speedie aide might lend at need;<br/>
Whether his first design be to withdraw<br/>
Our fealtie from God, or to disturb<br/>
Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss<br/>
Enjoy’d by us excites his envie more;<br/>
Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side<br/>
That gave thee being, stil shades thee and protects.<br/>
The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks,<br/>
Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies,<br/>
Who guards her, or with her the worst endures.<br/>

<p class="poem">
To whom the Virgin Majestie of <i>Eve</i>,<br/>
As one who loves, and some unkindness meets,<br/>
With sweet austeer composure thus reply’d.<br/>

<p class="poem">
Ofspring of Heav’n and Earth, and all Earths Lord,<br/>
That such an enemie we have, who seeks<br/>
Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne,<br/>
And from the parting Angel over-heard<br/>
As in a shadie nook I stood behind,<br/>
Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours.<br/>
But that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt<br/>
To God or thee, because we have a foe<br/>
May tempt it, I expected not to hear.<br/>
His violence thou fearst not, being such,<br/>
As wee, not capable of death or paine,<br/>
Can either not receave, or can repell.<br/>
His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs<br/>
Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love<br/>
Can by his fraud be shak’n or seduc’t;<br/>
Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy Brest,<br/>
<i>Adam</i>, misthought of her to thee so dear?<br/>

<p class="poem">
To whom with healing words <i>Adam</i> reply’d.<br/>
Daughter of God and Man, immortal <i>Eve</i>,<br/>
For such thou art, from sin and blame entire:<br/>
Not diffident of thee do I dissuade<br/>
Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid<br/>
Th’ attempt it self, intended by our Foe.<br/>
For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses<br/>
The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos’d<br/>
Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff<br/>
Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne<br/>
And anger wouldst resent the offer’d wrong,<br/>
Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then,<br/>
If such affront I labour to avert<br/>
From thee alone, which on us both at once<br/>
The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare,<br/>
Or daring, first on mee th’ assault shall light.<br/>
Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn;<br/>
Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce<br/>
Angels, nor think superfluous others aid.<br/>
I from the influence of thy looks receave<br/>
Access in every Vertue, in thy sight<br/>
More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were<br/>
Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on,<br/>
Shame to be overcome or over-reacht<br/>
Would utmost vigor raise, and rais’d unite.<br/>
Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel<br/>
When I am present, and thy trial choose<br/>
With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri’d.<br/>

<p class="poem">
So spake domestick <i>Adam</i> in his care<br/>
And Matrimonial Love, but <i>Eve</i>, who thought<br/>
Less attributed to her Faith sincere,<br/>
Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd.<br/>

<p class="poem">
If this be our condition, thus to dwell<br/>
In narrow circuit strait’nd by a Foe,<br/>
Suttle or violent, we not endu’d<br/>
Single with like defence, wherever met,<br/>
How are we happie, still in fear of harm?<br/>
But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe<br/>
Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem<br/>
Of our integritie: his foul esteeme<br/>
Sticks no dishonor on our Front, but turns<br/>
Foul on himself; then wherfore shund or feard<br/>
By us? who rather double honour gaine<br/>
From his surmise prov’d false, finde peace within,<br/>
Favour from Heav’n, our witness from th’ event.<br/>
And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid<br/>
Alone, without exterior help sustaind?<br/>
Let us not then suspect our happie State<br/>
Left so imperfet by the Maker wise,<br/>
As not secure to single or combin’d.<br/>
Fraile is our happiness, if this be so,<br/>
And <i>Eden</i> were no <i>Eden</i> thus expos’d.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
To whom thus <i>Adam</i> fervently repli’d.<br/>
O Woman, best are all things as the will<br/>
Of God ordaind them, his creating hand<br/>
Nothing imperfet or deficient left<br/>
Of all that he Created, much less Man,<br/>
Or ought that might his happie State secure,<br/>
Secure from outward force; within himself<br/>
The danger lies, yet lies within his power:<br/>
Against his will he can receave no harme.<br/>
But God left free the Will, for what obeyes<br/>
Reason, is free, and Reason he made right,<br/>
But bid her well beware, and still erect,<br/>
Least by some faire appeering good surpris’d<br/>
She dictate false, and missinforme the Will<br/>
To do what God expresly hath forbid.<br/>
Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes,<br/>
That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me.<br/>
Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve,<br/>
Since Reason not impossibly may meet<br/>
Some specious object by the Foe subornd,<br/>
And fall into deception unaware,<br/>
Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd.<br/>
Seek not temptation then, which to avoide<br/>
Were better, and most likelie if from mee<br/>
Thou sever not; Trial will come unsought.<br/>
Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve<br/>
First thy obedience; th’ other who can know,<br/>
Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?<br/>
But if thou think, trial unsought may finde<br/>
Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst,<br/>
Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more;<br/>
Go in thy native innocence, relie<br/>
On what thou hast of vertue, summon all,<br/>
For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine.<br/>

So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but <i>Eve</i><br/>
Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli’d.<br/>

With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd<br/>
Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words<br/>

A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek;<br/>
So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse.<br/>
Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand<br/>
Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light<br/>
<i>Oread</i> or <i>Dryad</i>, or of <i>Delia’s</i> Traine,<br/>
Betook her to the Groves, but <i>Delia’s</i> self<br/>
In gate surpass’d and Goddess-like deport,<br/>

To intercept thy way, or send thee back<br/>
Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss.<br/>
For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend,<br/>
Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come,<br/>
And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde<br/>
The onely two of Mankinde, but in them<br/>
The whole included Race, his purposd prey.<br/>
In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft<br/>
Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay,<br/>
Thir tendance or Plantation for delight,<br/>
By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet<br/>
He sought them both, but wish’d his hap might find<br/>
<i>Eve</i> separate, he wish’d, but not with hope<br/>
Of what so seldom chanc’d, when to his wish,<br/>
Beyond his hope, <i>Eve</i> separate he spies,<br/>
Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood,<br/>
Half spi’d, so thick the Roses bushing round<br/>
About her glowd, oft stooping to support<br/>
Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay<br/>
Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold,<br/>
Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies<br/>
Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while,<br/>

<i>Alcinous</i>, host of old <i>Laertes</i> Son,<br/>
Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King<br/>
Held dalliance with his faire <i>Egyptian</i> Spouse.<br/>
Much hee the Place admir’d, the Person more.<br/>
As one who long in populous City pent,<br/>
Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire,<br/>
Forth issuing on a Summers Morn, to breathe<br/>
Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes<br/>
Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight,<br/>
The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine,<br/>
Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound;<br/>
If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass,<br/>
What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more,<br/>
She most, and in her look summs all Delight.<br/>
Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold<br/>
This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of <i>Eve</i><br/>
Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav’nly forme<br/>
Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine,<br/>
Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire<br/>
Of gesture or lest action overawd<br/>
His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav’d<br/>
His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought:<br/>
That space the Evil one abstracted stood<br/>
From his own evil, and for the time remaind<br/>
Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm’d,<br/>
Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge;<br/>
But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes,<br/>
Though in mid Heav’n, soon ended his delight,<br/>
And tortures him now more, the more he sees<br/>
Of pleasure not for him ordain’d: then soon<br/>
Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts<br/>
Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thoughts, whither have he led me, with what sweet<br/>
Compulsion thus transported to forget<br/>
What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope<br/>
Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste<br/>
Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy,<br/>
Save what is in destroying, other joy<br/>
To me is lost.  Then let me not let pass<br/>
Occasion which now smiles, behold alone<br/>
The Woman, opportune to all attempts,<br/>
Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh,<br/>
Whose higher intellectual more I shun,<br/>
And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb<br/>
Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould,<br/>
Foe not informidable, exempt from wound,<br/>
I not; so much hath Hell debas’d, and paine<br/>
Infeebl’d me, to what I was in Heav’n.<br/>
Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods,<br/>
Not terrible, though terrour be in Love<br/>
And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate,<br/>
Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign’d,<br/>
The way which to her ruin now I tend.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos’d<br/>
In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward <i>Eve</i><br/>
Address’d his way, not with indented wave,<br/>
Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare,<br/>
Circular base of rising foulds, that tour’d<br/>
Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head<br/>
Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes;<br/>
With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect<br/>
Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass<br/>
Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape,<br/>
And lovely, never since of Serpent kind<br/>
Lovelier, not those that in <i>Illyria</i> chang’d<br/>
<i>Hermione</i> and <i>Cadmus</i>, or the God<br/>
In <i>Epidaurus</i>; nor to which transformd<br/>
<i>Ammonian Jove</i>, or <i>Capitoline</i> was seen,<br/>
Hee with <i>Olympias</i>, this with her who bore<br/>
<i>Scipio</i> the highth of <i>Rome</i>.  With tract oblique<br/>
At first, as one who sought access, but feard<br/>
To interrupt, side-long he works his way.<br/>
As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought<br/>
Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind<br/>
Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile;<br/>
So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine<br/>
Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of <i>Eve</i>,<br/>
To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound<br/>
Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us’d<br/>
To such disport before her through the Field,<br/>
From every Beast, more duteous at her call,<br/>
Then at <i>Circean</i> call the Herd disguis’d.<br/>
Hee boulder now, uncall’d before her stood;<br/>
But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd<br/>
His turret Crest, and sleek enamel’d Neck,<br/>
Fawning, and lick’d the ground whereon she trod.<br/>
His gentle dumb expression turnd at length<br/>
The Eye of <i>Eve</i> to mark his play; he glad<br/>
Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue<br/>
Organic, or impulse of vocal Air,<br/>
His fraudulent temptation thus began.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps<br/>
Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm<br/>
Thy looks, the Heav’n of mildness, with disdain,<br/>
Displeas’d that I approach thee thus, and gaze<br/>
Insatiate, I thus single; nor have feard<br/>
Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir’d.<br/>
Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire,<br/>
Thee all living things gaze on, all things thine<br/>
By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore<br/>
With ravishment beheld, there best beheld<br/>
Where universally admir’d; but here<br/>
In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among,<br/>
Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne<br/>
Half what in thee is fair, one man except,<br/>
Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen<br/>
A Goddess among Gods, ador’d and serv’d<br/>
By Angels numberless, thy daily Train.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So gloz’d the Tempter, and his Proem tun’d;<br/>
Into the Heart of <i>Eve</i> his words made way,<br/>
Though at the voice much marveling; at length<br/>
Not unamaz’d she thus in answer spake.<br/>
What may this mean?  Language of Man pronounc’t<br/>
By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest?<br/>
The first at lest of these I thought deni’d<br/>
To Beasts, whom God on their Creation-Day<br/>
Created mute to all articulat sound;<br/>
The latter I demurre, for in thir looks<br/>
Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers.<br/>
Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field<br/>
I knew, but not with human voice endu’d;<br/>
Redouble then this miracle, and say,<br/>
How cam’st thou speakable of mute, and how<br/>
To me so friendly grown above the rest<br/>
Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight?<br/>
Say, for such wonder claims attention due.<br/>

<p class="poem">
To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply’d.<br/>
Empress of this fair World, resplendent <i>Eve</i>,<br/>
Easie to mee it is to tell thee all<br/>
What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd:<br/>
I was at first as other Beasts that graze<br/>
The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low,<br/>
As was my food, nor aught but food discern’d<br/>
Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high:<br/>
Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc’d<br/>
A goodly Tree farr distant to behold<br/>
Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt,<br/>
Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze;<br/>
When from the boughes a savorie odour blow’n,<br/>
Grateful to appetite, more pleas’d my sense<br/>
Then smell of sweetest Fenel, or the Teats<br/>
Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn,<br/>
Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play.<br/>
To satisfie the sharp desire I had<br/>
Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv’d<br/>
Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once,<br/>
Powerful perswaders, quick’nd at the scent<br/>
Of that alluring fruit, urg’d me so keene.<br/>
About the Mossie Trunk I wound me soon,<br/>
For high from ground the branches would require<br/>
Thy utmost reach or <i>Adams</i>: Round the Tree<br/>
All other Beasts that saw, with like desire<br/>
Longing and envying stood, but could not reach.<br/>
Amid the Tree now got, where plentie hung<br/>
Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill<br/>
I spar’d not, for such pleasure till that hour<br/>
At Feed or Fountain never had I found.<br/>
Sated at length, ere long I might perceave<br/>
Strange alteration in me, to degree<br/>
Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech<br/>
Wanted not long, though to this shape retaind.<br/>
Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep<br/>
I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind<br/>
Considerd all things visible in Heav’n,<br/>
Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good;<br/>
But all that fair and good in thy Divine<br/>
Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav’nly Ray<br/>
United I beheld; no Fair to thine<br/>
Equivalent or second, which compel’d<br/>
Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come<br/>
And gaze, and worship thee of right declar’d<br/>
Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So talk’d the spirited sly Snake; and <i>Eve</i><br/>
Yet more amaz’d unwarie thus reply’d.<br/>

Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt<br/>
The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov’d:<br/>
But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far?<br/>
For many are the Trees of God that grow<br/>
In Paradise, and various, yet unknown<br/>
To us, in such abundance lies our choice,<br/>
As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht,<br/>
Still hanging incorruptible, till men<br/>
Grow up to thir provision, and more hands<br/>
Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth.<br/>

Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night<br/>

Misleads th’ amaz’d Night-wanderer from his way<br/>

O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant,<br/>
Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power<br/>
Within me cleere, not onely to discerne<br/>
Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes<br/>
Of highest Agents, deemd however wise.<br/>
Queen of this Universe, doe not believe<br/>
Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die:<br/>
How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life<br/>
To Knowledge?  By the Threatner, look on mee,<br/>
Mee who have touch’d and tasted, yet both live,<br/>
And life more perfet have attaind then Fate<br/>
Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot.<br/>
Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast<br/>
Is open? or will God incense his ire<br/>
For such a pretty Trespass, and not praise<br/>
Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain<br/>
Of Death denounc’t, whatever thing Death be,<br/>
Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade<br/>
To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil;<br/>
Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil<br/>
Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd?<br/>
God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just;<br/>
Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeid:<br/>
Your feare it self of Death removes the feare.<br/>
Why then was this forbid?  Why but to awe,<br/>
Why but to keep ye low and ignorant,<br/>
His worshippers; he knows that in the day<br/>
Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere,<br/>
Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then<br/>
Op’nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods,<br/>
Knowing both Good and Evil as they know.<br/>
That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man,<br/>
Internal Man, is but proportion meet,<br/>
I of brute human, yee of human Gods.<br/>
So ye shalt die perhaps, by putting off<br/>
Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht,<br/>
Though threat’nd, which no worse then this can bring<br/>
And what are Gods that Man may not become<br/>
As they, participating God-like food?<br/>
The Gods are first, and that advantage use<br/>
On our belief, that all from them proceeds,<br/>
I question it, for this fair Earth I see,<br/>
Warm’d by the Sun, producing every kind,<br/>
Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos’d<br/>
Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree,<br/>
That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains<br/>
Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies<br/>
Th’ offence, that Man should thus attain to know?<br/>
What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree<br/>
Impart against his will if all be his?<br/>
Or is it envie, and can envie dwell<br/>
In heav’nly brests? these, these and many more<br/>
Causes import your need of this fair Fruit.<br/>
Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste.<br/>

<p class="poem">
He ended, and his words replete with guile<br/>
Into her heart too easie entrance won:<br/>
Fixt on the Fruit she gaz’d, which to behold<br/>
Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound<br/>
Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn’d<br/>
With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth;<br/>
Meanwhile the hour of Noon drew on, and wak’d<br/>
An eager appetite, rais’d by the smell<br/>
So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire,<br/>
Inclinable now grown to touch or taste,<br/>
Sollicited her longing eye; yet first<br/>
Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus’d.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits,<br/>
Though kept from Man, &amp; worthy to be admir’d,<br/>
Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay<br/>
Gave elocution to the mute, and taught<br/>
The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise:<br/>
Thy praise hee also who forbids thy use,<br/>
Conceales not from us, naming thee the Tree<br/>
Of Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil;<br/>
Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding<br/>
Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good<br/>
By thee communicated, and our want:<br/>
For good unknown, sure is not had, or had<br/>
And yet unknown, is as not had at all.<br/>
In plain then, what forbids he but to know,<br/>
Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise?<br/>
Such prohibitions binde not.  But if Death<br/>
Bind us with after-bands, what profits then<br/>
Our inward freedom?  In the day we eate<br/>
Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die.<br/>
How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat’n and lives,<br/>
And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discernes,<br/>
Irrational till then.  For us alone<br/>
Was death invented? or to us deni’d<br/>
This intellectual food, for beasts reserv’d?<br/>
For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first<br/>
Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy<br/>
The good befall’n him, Author unsuspect,<br/>
Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile.<br/>
What fear I then, rather what know to feare<br/>
Under this ignorance of Good and Evil,<br/>
Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie?<br/>
Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine,<br/>
Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste,<br/>
Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then<br/>
To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind?<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So saying, her rash hand in evil hour<br/>
Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck’d, she eat:<br/>
Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat<br/>
Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe,<br/>
That all was lost.  Back to the Thicket slunk<br/>
The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for <i>Eve</i><br/>
Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else<br/>
Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd,<br/>
In Fruit she never tasted, whether true<br/>
Or fansied so, through expectation high<br/>
Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought.<br/>
Greedily she ingorg’d without restraint,<br/>
And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length,<br/>
And hight’nd as with Wine, jocond and boon,<br/>
Thus to her self she pleasingly began.<br/>

Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise<br/>
Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease<br/>
Of thy full branches offer’d free to all;<br/>
Till dieted by thee I grow mature<br/>
In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know;<br/>
Though others envie what they cannot give;<br/>
For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here<br/>
Thus grown.  Experience, next to thee I owe,<br/>
Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind<br/>
In ignorance, thou op’nst Wisdoms way,<br/>
And giv’st access, though secret she retire.<br/>
And I perhaps am secret; Heav’n is high,<br/>
High and remote to see from thence distinct<br/>
Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps<br/>
May have diverted from continual watch<br/>
Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies<br/>
About him.  But to <i>Adam</i> in what sort<br/>
Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known<br/>
As yet my change, and give him to partake<br/>
Full happiness with mee, or rather not,<br/>
But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power<br/>
Without Copartner? so to add what wants<br/>
In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love,<br/>
And render me more equal, and perhaps<br/>
A thing not undesireable, somtime<br/>
Superior; for inferior who is free?<br/>
This may be well: but what if God have seen,<br/>

From Nectar, drink of Gods.  <i>Adam</i> the while<br/>
Waiting desirous her return, had wove<br/>
Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne<br/>
Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown<br/>
As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen.<br/>
Great joy he promis’d to his thoughts, and new<br/>
Solace in her return, so long delay’d;<br/>
Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill,<br/>
Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt;<br/>
And forth to meet her went, the way she took<br/>
That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree<br/>
Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met,<br/>
Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand<br/>
A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil’d,<br/>
New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus’d.<br/>
To him she hasted, in her face excuse<br/>
Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt,<br/>

Mean I to trie, what rash untri’d I sought,<br/>
The paine of absence from thy sight.  But strange<br/>
Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare:<br/>
This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree<br/>
Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown<br/>
Op’ning the way, but of Divine effect<br/>
To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste;<br/>
And hath bin tasted such; the Serpent wise,<br/>
Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying,<br/>
Hath eat’n of the fruit, and is become,<br/>
Not dead, as we are threatn’d, but thenceforth<br/>
Endu’d with human voice and human sense,<br/>
Reasoning to admiration, and with mee<br/>
Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I<br/>
Have also tasted, and have also found<br/>
Th’ effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes,<br/>
Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart,<br/>
And growing up to Godhead; which for thee<br/>
Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise.<br/>
For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss,<br/>
Tedious, unshar’d with thee, and odious soon.<br/>

Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life;<br/>
So forcible within my heart I feel<br/>
The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne,<br/>
My own in thee, for what thou art is mine;<br/>
Our State cannot be severd, we are one,<br/>
One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So <i>Adam</i>, and thus <i>Eve</i> to him repli’d.<br/>
O glorious trial of exceeding Love,<br/>
Illustrious evidence, example high!<br/>
Ingaging me to emulate, but short<br/>
Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine,<br/>
<i>Adam</i>, from whose deare side I boast me sprung,<br/>
And gladly of our Union heare thee speak,<br/>
One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff<br/>
This day affords, declaring thee resolvd,<br/>
Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread<br/>
Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare,<br/>
To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime,<br/>
If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit,<br/>
Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds,<br/>
Direct, or by occasion hath presented<br/>
This happie trial of thy Love, which else<br/>
So eminently never had bin known.<br/>
Were it I thought Death menac’t would ensue<br/>
This my attempt, I would sustain alone<br/>
The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die<br/>
Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact<br/>
Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur’d<br/>
Remarkably so late of thy so true,<br/>
So faithful Love unequald; but I feel<br/>
Farr otherwise th’ event, not Death, but Life<br/>
Augmented, op’nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes,<br/>
Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before<br/>
Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh.<br/>
On my experience, <i>Adam</i>, freely taste,<br/>
And fear of Death deliver to the Windes.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So saying, she embrac’d him, and for joy<br/>
Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love<br/>
Had so enobl’d, as of choice to incurr<br/>
Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death.<br/>
In recompence (for such compliance bad<br/>
Such recompence best merits) from the bough<br/>
She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit<br/>
With liberal hand: he scrupl’d not to eat<br/>
Against his better knowledge, not deceav’d,<br/>
But fondly overcome with Femal charm.<br/>
Earth trembl’d from her entrails, as again<br/>
In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan,<br/>
Skie lowr’d, and muttering Thunder, som sad drops<br/>
Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin<br/>
Original; while <i>Adam</i> took no thought,<br/>
Eating his fill, nor <i>Eve</i> to iterate<br/>
Her former trespass fear’d, the more to soothe<br/>
Him with her lov’d societie, that now<br/>
As with new Wine intoxicated both<br/>
They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel<br/>
Divinitie within them breeding wings<br/>
Wherewith to scorn the Earth: but that false Fruit<br/>
Farr other operation first displaid,<br/>
Carnal desire enflaming, hee on <i>Eve</i><br/>
Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him<br/>
As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne:<br/>
Till <i>Adam</i> thus ’gan <i>Eve</i> to dalliance move.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
<i>Eve</i>, now I see thou art exact of taste,<br/>
And elegant, of Sapience no small part,<br/>
Since to each meaning savour we apply,<br/>
And Palate call judicious; I the praise<br/>
Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey’d.<br/>
Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain’d<br/>
From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now<br/>
True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be<br/>
In things to us forbidden, it might be wish’d,<br/>
For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten.<br/>
But come, so well refresh’t, now let us play,<br/>
As meet is, after such delicious Fare;<br/>
For never did thy Beautie since the day<br/>
I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn’d<br/>
With all perfections, so enflame my sense<br/>
With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now<br/>
Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So said he, and forbore not glance or toy<br/>
Of amorous intent, well understood<br/>
Of <i>Eve</i>, whose Eye darted contagious Fire.<br/>
Her hand he seis’d, and to a shadie bank,<br/>
Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr’d<br/>
He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch,<br/>
Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel,<br/>
And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap.<br/>
There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport<br/>
Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale,<br/>
The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep<br/>
Oppress’d them, wearied with thir amorous play.<br/>
Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit,<br/>
That with exhilerating vapour bland<br/>
About thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers<br/>
Made erre, was now exhal’d, and grosser sleep<br/>
Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams<br/>
Encumberd, now had left them, up they rose<br/>
As from unrest, and each the other viewing,<br/>
Soon found thir Eyes how op’nd, and thir minds<br/>
How dark’nd; innocence, that as a veile<br/>
Had shadow’d them from knowing ill, was gon,<br/>
Just confidence, and native righteousness,<br/>
And honour from about them, naked left<br/>
To guiltie shame hee cover’d, but his Robe<br/>
Uncover’d more.  So rose the <i>Danite</i> strong<br/>
<i>Herculean Samson</i> from the Harlot-lap<br/>
Of <i>Philistean Dalilah</i>, and wak’d<br/>
Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare<br/>
Of all thir vertue: silent, and in face<br/>
Confounded long they sate, as struck’n mute,<br/>
Till <i>Adam</i>, though not less then <i>Eve</i> abasht,<br/>
At length gave utterance to these words constraind.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O <i>Eve</i>, in evil hour thou didst give care<br/>
To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught<br/>
To counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall,<br/>
False in our promis’d Rising; since our Eyes<br/>
Op’nd we find indeed, and find we know<br/>
Both Good and Evil, Good lost and Evil got,<br/>
Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know,<br/>
Which leaves us naked thus, of Honour void,<br/>
Of Innocence, of Faith, of Puritie,<br/>
Our wonted Ornaments now soild and staind,<br/>
And in our Faces evident the signes<br/>
Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store;<br/>
Even shame, the last of evils; of the first<br/>
Be sure then.  How shall I behold the face<br/>
Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy<br/>
And rapture so oft beheld? those heav’nly shapes<br/>
Will dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze<br/>
Insufferably bright.  O might I here<br/>
In solitude live savage, in some glad<br/>
Obscur’d, where highest Woods impenetrable<br/>
To Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad,<br/>
And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines,<br/>
Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs<br/>
Hide me, where I may never see them more.<br/>
But let us now, as in bad plight, devise<br/>
What best may for the present serve to hide<br/>
The Parts of each from other, that seem most<br/>
To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen,<br/>
Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd,<br/>
And girded on our loyns, may cover round<br/>
Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame,<br/>
There sit not, and reproach us as unclean.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So counsel’d hee, and both together went<br/>
Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose<br/>
The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown’d,<br/>
But such as at this day to <i>Indians</i> known<br/>
In <i>Malabar</i> or <i>Decan</i> spreds her Armes<br/>
Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground<br/>
The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow<br/>
About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade<br/>
High overarch’t, and echoing Walks between;<br/>
There oft the <i>Indian</i> Herdsman shunning heate<br/>
Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds<br/>
At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves<br/>
They gatherd, broad as <i>Amazonian</i> Targe,<br/>
And with what skill they had, together sowd,<br/>
To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide<br/>
Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike<br/>
To that first naked Glorie.  Such of late<br/>
<i>Columbus</i> found th’ <i>American</i> to girt<br/>
With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde<br/>
Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores.<br/>
Thus fenc’t, and as they thought, thir shame in part<br/>
Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind,<br/>
They sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares<br/>
Raind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within<br/>
Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate,<br/>
Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore<br/>
Thir inward State of Mind, calme Region once<br/>
And full of Peace, now tost and turbulent:<br/>
For Understanding rul’d not, and the Will<br/>
Heard not her lore, both in subjection now<br/>
To sensual Appetite, who from beneathe<br/>
Usurping over sovran Reason claimd<br/>
Superior sway: From thus distemperd brest,<br/>
<i>Adam</i>, estrang’d in look and alterd stile,<br/>
Speech intermitted thus to <i>Eve</i> renewd.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Would thou hadst heark’nd to my words, &amp; stai’d<br/>
With me, as I besought thee, when that strange<br/>
Desire of wandring this unhappie Morn,<br/>
I know not whence possessd thee; we had then<br/>
Remaind still happie, not as now, despoild<br/>
Of all our good, sham’d, naked, miserable.<br/>
Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve<br/>
The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek<br/>
Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
To whom soon mov’d with touch of blame thus <i>Eve</i>.<br/>
What words have past thy Lips, <i>Adam</i> severe,<br/>
Imput’st thou that to my default, or will<br/>
Of wandering, as thou call’st it, which who knows<br/>
But might as ill have happ’nd thou being by,<br/>
Or to thy self perhaps: hadst thou bin there,<br/>
Or bere th’ attempt, thou couldst not have discernd<br/>
Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake;<br/>
No ground of enmitie between us known,<br/>
Why hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme.<br/>
Was I to have never parted from thy side?<br/>
As good have grown there still a liveless Rib.<br/>
Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head<br/>
Command me absolutely not to go,<br/>
Going into such danger as thou saidst?<br/>
Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay,<br/>
Nay, didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss.<br/>
Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent,<br/>
Neither had I transgress’d, nor thou with mee.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
To whom then first incenst <i>Adam</i> repli’d.<br/>
Is this the Love, is the recompence<br/>
Of mine to thee, ingrateful <i>Eve</i>, exprest<br/>
Immutable when thou wert lost, not I,<br/>
Who might have liv’d and joyd immortal bliss,<br/>
Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee:<br/>
And am I now upbraided, as the cause<br/>
Of thy transgressing? not enough severe,<br/>
It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more?<br/>
I warn’d thee, I admonish’d thee, foretold<br/>
The danger, and the lurking Enemie<br/>
That lay in wait; beyond this had bin force,<br/>
And force upon free Will hath here no place.<br/>
But confidence then bore thee on, secure<br/>
Either to meet no danger, or to finde<br/>
Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps<br/>
I also err’d in overmuch admiring<br/>
What seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought<br/>
No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue<br/>
That errour now, which is become my crime,<br/>
And thou th’ accuser.  Thus it shall befall<br/>
Him who to worth in Women overtrusting<br/>
Lets her Will rule; restraint she will not brook,<br/>
And left to her self, if evil thence ensue,<br/>
Shee first his weak indulgence will accuse.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thus they in mutual accusation spent<br/>
The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning<br/>
And of thir vain contest appeer’d no end.<br/>

<p class="pfirst">
<span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>eanwhile the hainous and despightfull act<br/>
Of <i>Satan</i> done in Paradise, and how<br/>
Hee in the Serpent had perverted <i>Eve</i>,<br/>
Her Husband shee, to taste the fatall fruit,<br/>
Was known in Heav’n; for what can scape the Eye<br/>
Of God All-seeing, or deceave his Heart<br/>
Omniscient, who in all things wise and just,<br/>
Hinder’d not <i>Satan</i> to attempt the minde<br/>
Of Man, with strength entire, and free Will arm’d,<br/>
Complete to have discover’d and repulst<br/>
Whatever wiles of Foe or seeming Friend.<br/>
For still they knew, and ought to have still remember’d<br/>
The high Injunction not to taste that Fruit,<br/>
Whoever tempted; which they not obeying,<br/>
Incurr’d, what could they less, the penaltie,<br/>
And manifold in sin, deserv’d to fall.<br/>
Up into Heav’n from Paradise in hast<br/>
Th’ Angelic Guards ascended, mute and sad<br/>
For Man, for of his state by this they knew,<br/>
Much wondring how the suttle Fiend had stoln<br/>
Entrance unseen.  Soon as th’ unwelcome news<br/>
From Earth arriv’d at Heaven Gate, displeas’d<br/>
All were who heard, dim sadness did not spare<br/>
That time Celestial visages, yet mixt<br/>
With pitie, violated not thir bliss.<br/>
About the new-arriv’d, in multitudes<br/>
Th’ ethereal People ran, to hear and know<br/>
How all befell: they towards the Throne Supream<br/>
Accountable made haste to make appear<br/>
With righteous plea, thir utmost vigilance,<br/>
And easily approv’d; when the most High<br/>
Eternal Father from his secret Cloud,<br/>
Amidst in Thunder utter’d thus his voice.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Assembl’d Angels, and ye Powers return’d<br/>
From unsuccessful charge, be not dismaid,<br/>
Nor troubl’d at these tidings from the Earth,<br/>
Which your sincerest care could not prevent,<br/>
Foretold so lately what would come to pass,<br/>
When first this Tempter cross’d the Gulf from Hell.<br/>
I told ye then he should prevail and speed<br/>
On his bad Errand, Man should be seduc’t<br/>
And flatter’d out of all, believing lies<br/>
Against his Maker; no Decree of mine<br/>
Concurring to necessitate his Fall,<br/>
Or touch with lightest moment of impulse<br/>
His free Will, to her own inclining left<br/>
In eevn scale.  But fall’n he is, and now<br/>
What rests, but that the mortal Sentence pass<br/>
On his transgression, Death denounc’t that day,<br/>
Which he presumes already vain and void,<br/>
Because not yet inflicted, as he fear’d,<br/>
By some immediate stroak; but soon shall find<br/>
Forbearance no acquittance ere day end.<br/>
Justice shall not return as bountie scorn’d.<br/>
But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee<br/>
Vicegerent Son, to thee I have transferr’d<br/>
All Judgement, whether in Heav’n, or Earth; or Hell.<br/>
Easie it may be seen that I intend<br/>
Mercie collegue with Justice, sending thee<br/>
Mans Friend, his Mediator, his design’d<br/>
Both Ransom and Redeemer voluntarie,<br/>
And destin’d Man himself to judge Man fall’n.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake the Father, and unfoulding bright<br/>
Toward the right hand his Glorie, on the Son<br/>
Blaz’d forth unclouded Deitie; he full<br/>
Resplendent all his Father manifest<br/>
Express’d, and thus divinely answer’d milde.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Father Eternal, thine is to decree,<br/>
Mine both in Heav’n and Earth to do thy will<br/>
Supream, that thou in mee thy Son belov’d<br/>
Mayst ever rest well pleas’d.  I go to judge<br/>
On Earth these thy transgressors, but thou knowst,<br/>
Whoever judg’d, the worst on mee must light,<br/>
When time shall be, for so I undertook<br/>
Before thee; and not repenting, this obtaine<br/>
Of right, that I may mitigate thir doom<br/>
On me deriv’d, yet I shall temper so<br/>
Justice with Mercie, as may illustrate most<br/>
Them fully satisfied, and thee appease.<br/>
Attendance none shall need, nor Train, where none<br/>
Are to behold the Judgement, but the judg’d,<br/>
Those two; the third best absent is condemn’d,<br/>
Convict by flight, and Rebel to all Law<br/>
Conviction to the Serpent none belongs.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thus saying, from his radiant Seat he rose<br/>
Of high collateral glorie: him Thrones and Powers,<br/>
Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant<br/>
Accompanied to Heaven Gate, from whence<br/>
<i>Eden</i> and all the Coast in prospect lay.<br/>
Down he descended strait; the speed of Gods<br/>
Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes wing’d.<br/>
Now was the Sun in Western cadence low<br/>
From Noon, and gentle Aires due at thir hour<br/>
To fan the Earth now wak’d, and usher in<br/>
The Eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole<br/>
Came the mild Judge and Intercessor both<br/>
To sentence Man: the voice of God they heard<br/>
Now walking in the Garden, by soft windes<br/>
Brought to thir Ears, while day declin’d, they heard<br/>
And from his presence hid themselves among<br/>
The thickest Trees, both Man and Wife, till God<br/>
Approaching, thus to <i>Adam</i> call’d aloud.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Where art thou <i>Adam</i>, wont with joy to meet<br/>
My coming seen far off?  I miss thee here,<br/>
Not pleas’d, thus entertaind with solitude,<br/>
Where obvious dutie erewhile appear’d unsaught:<br/>
Or come I less conspicuous, or what change<br/>
Absents thee, or what chance detains?  Come forth.<br/>
He came, and with him <i>Eve</i>, more loth, though first<br/>
To offend, discount’nanc’t both, and discompos’d;<br/>
Love was not in thir looks, either to God<br/>
Or to each other, but apparent guilt,<br/>
And shame, and perturbation, and despaire,<br/>
Anger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile.<br/>
Whence <i>Adam</i> faultring long, thus answer’d brief.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
I heard thee in the Garden, and of thy voice<br/>
Affraid, being naked, hid my self.  To whom<br/>
The gracious Judge without revile repli’d.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not fear’d,<br/>
But still rejoyc’t, how is it now become<br/>
So dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who<br/>
Hath told thee? hast thou eaten of the Tree<br/>
Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
To whom thus <i>Adam</i> sore beset repli’d.<br/>
O Heav’n! in evil strait this day I stand<br/>
Before my Judge, either to undergoe<br/>
My self the total Crime, or to accuse<br/>
My other self, the partner of my life;<br/>
Whose failing, while her Faith to me remaines,<br/>
I should conceal, and not expose to blame<br/>
By my complaint; but strict necessitie<br/>
Subdues me, and calamitous constraint,<br/>
Least on my head both sin and punishment,<br/>
However insupportable, be all<br/>
Devolv’d; though should I hold my peace, yet thou<br/>
Wouldst easily detect what I conceale.<br/>
This Woman whom thou mad’st to be my help,<br/>
And gav’st me as thy perfet gift, so good,<br/>
So fit, so acceptable, so Divine,<br/>
That from her hand I could suspect no ill,<br/>
And what she did, whatever in it self,<br/>
Her doing seem’d to justifie the deed;<br/>
Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
To whom the sovran Presence thus repli’d.<br/>
Was shee thy God, that her thou didst obey<br/>
Before his voice, or was shee made thy guide,<br/>
Superior, or but equal, that to her<br/>
Thou did’st resigne thy Manhood, and the Place<br/>
Wherein God set thee above her made of thee,<br/>
And for thee, whose perfection farr excell’d<br/>
Hers in all real dignitie: Adornd<br/>
She was indeed, and lovely to attract<br/>
Thy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts<br/>
Were such as under Government well seem’d,<br/>
Unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part<br/>
And person, had’st thou known thy self aright.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So having said, he thus to <i>Eve</i> in few:<br/>
Say Woman, what is this which thou hast done?<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
To whom sad <i>Eve</i> with shame nigh overwhelm’d,<br/>
Confessing soon, yet not before her Judge<br/>
Bold or loquacious, thus abasht repli’d.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
The Serpent me beguil’d and I did eate.</p>
<p class="poem">
Which when the Lord God heard, without delay<br/>
To Judgement he proceeded on th’ accus’d<br/>
Serpent though brute, unable to transferre<br/>
The Guilt on him who made him instrument<br/>
Of mischief, and polluted from the end<br/>
Of his Creation; justly then accurst,<br/>
As vitiated in Nature: more to know<br/>
Concern’d not Man (since he no further knew)<br/>
Nor alter’d his offence; yet God at last<br/>
To Satan first in sin his doom apply’d,<br/>
Though in mysterious terms, judg’d as then best:<br/>
And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst<br/>
Above all Cattel, each Beast of the Field;<br/>
Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe,<br/>
And dust shalt eat all the days of thy Life.<br/>
Between Thee and the Woman I will put<br/>
Enmitie, and between thine and her Seed;<br/>
Her Seed shall bruise thy head, thou bruise his heel.<br/>

So spake this Oracle, then verifi’d<br/>
When <i>Jesus</i> son of <i>Mary</i> second <i>Eve</i>,<br/>
Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav’n,<br/>
Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave<br/>
Spoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht<br/>
In open shew, and with ascention bright<br/>
Captivity led captive through the Aire,<br/>
The Realme it self of Satan long usurpt,<br/>
Whom he shall tread at last under our feet;<br/>
Eevn hee who now foretold his fatal bruise,<br/>
And to the Woman thus his Sentence turn’d.<br/>

<p class="poem">
Thy sorrow I will greatly multiplie<br/>
By thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring<br/>
In sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will<br/>

<p class="poem">
On <i>Adam</i> last thus judgement he pronounc’d.<br/>
Because thou hast heark’nd to the voice of thy Wife,<br/>
And eaten of the Tree concerning which<br/>
I charg’d thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof,<br/>
Curs’d is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow<br/>
Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life;<br/>
Thornes also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth<br/>
Unbid, and thou shalt eate th’ Herb of th’ Field,<br/>
In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eate Bread,<br/>
Till thou return unto the ground, for thou<br/>
Out of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth,<br/>
For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
 So judg’d he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent,<br/>
And th’ instant stroke of Death denounc’t that day<br/>
Remov’d farr off; then pittying how they stood<br/>
Before him naked to the aire, that now<br/>
Must suffer change, disdain’d not to begin<br/>
Thenceforth the forme of servant to assume,<br/>
As when he wash’d his servants feet, so now<br/>
As Father of his Familie he clad<br/>
Thir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain,<br/>
Or as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid;<br/>
And thought not much to cloath his Enemies:<br/>
Nor hee thir outward onely with the Skins<br/>
Of Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more<br/>
Opprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness,<br/>
Araying cover’d from his Fathers sight.<br/>
To him with swift ascent he up returnd,<br/>
Into his blissful bosom reassum’d<br/>
In glory as of old, to him appeas’d<br/>
All, though all-knowing, what had past with Man<br/>
Recounted, mixing intercession sweet.<br/>
Meanwhile ere thus was sin’d and judg’d on Earth,<br/>
Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death,<br/>
In counterview within the Gates, that now<br/>
Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame<br/>
Farr into <i>Chaos</i>, since the Fiend pass’d through,<br/>
Sin opening, who thus now to Death began.<br/>

<p class="poem">
O Son, why sit we here each other viewing<br/>
Idlely, while Satan our great Author thrives<br/>
In other Worlds, and happier Seat provides<br/>
For us his ofspring deare?  It cannot be<br/>
But that success attends him; if mishap,<br/>
Ere this he had return’d, with fury driv’n<br/>
By his Avenger, since no place like this<br/>
Can fit his punishment, or their revenge.<br/>
Methinks I feel new strength within me rise,<br/>
Wings growing, and Dominion giv’n me large<br/>
Beyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on,<br/>

Impassable, impervious, let us try<br/>
Adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine<br/>
Not unagreeable, to found a path<br/>
Over this Maine from Hell to that new World<br/>
Where Satan now prevailes, a Monument<br/>
Of merit high to all th’ infernal Host,<br/>
Easing thir passage hence, for intercourse,<br/>

Leads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre<br/>
The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw<br/>
Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste<br/>
The savour of Death from all things there that live:<br/>
Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest<br/>
Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So saying, with delight he snuff’d the smell<br/>
Of mortal change on Earth.  As when a flock<br/>
Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote,<br/>
Against the day of Battel, to a Field,<br/>
Where Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur’d<br/>
With sent of living Carcasses design’d<br/>
For death, the following day, in bloodie fight.<br/>
So sented the grim Feature, and upturn’d<br/>
His Nostril wide into the murkie Air,<br/>
Sagacious of his Quarrey from so farr.<br/>
Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste<br/>
Wide Anarchie of <i>Chaos</i> damp and dark<br/>
Flew divers, &amp; with Power (thir Power was great)<br/>
Hovering upon the Waters; what they met<br/>
Solid or slimie, as in raging Sea<br/>
Tost up and down, together crowded drove<br/>
From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell.<br/>
As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse<br/>
Upon the <i>Cronian</i> Sea, together drive<br/>
Mountains of Ice, that stop th’ imagin’d way<br/>
Beyond <i>Petsora</i> Eastward, to the rich<br/>
<i>Cathaian</i> Coast.  The aggregated Soyle<br/>
Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry,<br/>
As with a Trident smote, and fix’t as firm<br/>
As <i>Delos</i> floating once; the rest his look<br/>
Bound with <i>Gorgonian</i> rigor not to move,<br/>
And with <i>Asphaltic</i> slime; broad as the Gate,<br/>
Deep to the Roots of Hell the gather’d beach<br/>
They fasten’d, and the Mole immense wraught on<br/>
Over the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge<br/>
Of length prodigious joyning to the Wall<br/>
Immoveable of this now fenceless world<br/>
Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad,<br/>
Smooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell.<br/>
So, if great things to small may be compar’d,<br/>
<i>Xerxes</i>, the Libertie of <i>Greece</i> to yoke,<br/>
From <i>Susa</i> his <i>Memnonian</i> Palace high<br/>
Came to the Sea, and over <i>Hellespont</i><br/>
Bridging his way, <i>Europe</i> with <i>Asia</i> joyn’d,<br/>
And scourg’d with many a stroak th’ indignant waves.<br/>
Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art<br/>
Pontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock<br/>
Over the vext Abyss, following the track<br/>
Of <i>Satan</i>, to the selfsame place where hee<br/>
First lighted from his Wing, and landed safe<br/>
From out of <i>Chaos</i> to the outside bare<br/>
Of this round World: with Pinns of Adamant<br/>
And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made<br/>
And durable; and now in little space<br/>
The Confines met of Empyrean Heav’n<br/>
And of this World, and on the left hand Hell<br/>
With long reach interpos’d; three sev’ral wayes<br/>
In sight, to each of these three places led.<br/>
And now thir way to Earth they had descri’d,<br/>
To Paradise first tending, when behold<br/>
<i>Satan</i> in likeness of an Angel bright<br/>
Betwixt the <i>Centaure</i> and the <i>Scorpion</i> stearing<br/>
His <i>Zenith</i>, while the Sun in <i>Aries</i> rose:<br/>
Disguis’d he came, but those his Children dear<br/>
Thir Parent soon discern’d, though in disguise.<br/>
Hee, after <i>Eve</i> seduc’t, unminded slunk<br/>
Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape<br/>
To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act<br/>
By <i>Eve</i>, though all unweeting, seconded<br/>
Upon her Husband, saw thir shame that sought<br/>
Vain covertures; but when he saw descend<br/>
The Son of God to judge them, terrifi’d<br/>
Hee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun<br/>
The present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth<br/>
Might suddenly inflict; that past, return’d<br/>
By Night, and listning where the hapless Paire<br/>
Sate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint,<br/>
Thence gatherd his own doom, which understood<br/>
Not instant, but of future time.  With joy<br/>
And tidings fraught, to Hell he now return’d,<br/>
And at the brink of <i>Chaos</i>, neer the foot<br/>
Of this new wondrous Pontifice, unhop’t<br/>
Met who to meet him came, his Ofspring dear.<br/>
Great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight<br/>
Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas’d.<br/>
Long hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire<br/>
Inchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke.<br/>

So saying he dismiss’d them, they with speed<br/>
Thir course through thickest Constellations held<br/>
Spreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan,<br/>
And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips<br/>
Then sufferd.  Th’ other way <i>Satan</i> went down<br/>
The Causey to Hell Gate; on either side<br/>
Disparted <i>Chaos</i> over built exclaimd,<br/>
And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild,<br/>
That scorn’d his indignation: through the Gate,<br/>
Wide open and unguarded, <i>Satan</i> pass’d,<br/>
And all about found desolate; for those<br/>
Appointed to sit there, had left thir charge,<br/>
Flown to the upper World; the rest were all<br/>

Of <i>Pandemonium</i>, Citie and proud seate<br/>
Of <i>Lucifer</i>, so by allusion calld,<br/>
Of that bright Starr to <i>Satan</i> paragond.<br/>
There kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand<br/>
In Council sate, sollicitous what chance<br/>

As when the <i>Tartar</i> from his <i>Russian</i> Foe<br/>
By <i>Astracan</i> over the Snowie Plaines<br/>

Of lowest order, past; and from the dore<br/>
Of that <i>Plutonian</i> Hall, invisible<br/>
Ascended his high Throne, which under state<br/>
Of richest texture spred, at th’ upper end<br/>

At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head<br/>

Abominable, accurst, the house of woe,<br/>

Little inferiour, by my adventure hard<br/>

To expedite your glorious march; but I<br/>
Toild out my uncouth passage, forc’t to ride<br/>
Th’ untractable Abysse, plung’d in the womb<br/>
Of unoriginal <i>Night</i> and <i>Chaos</i> wilde,<br/>
That jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos’d<br/>
My journey strange, with clamorous uproare<br/>
Protesting Fate supreame; thence how I found<br/>
The new created World, which fame in Heav’n<br/>
Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful<br/>
Of absolute perfection, therein Man<br/>
Plac’t in a Paradise, by our exile<br/>
Made happie: Him by fraud I have seduc’d<br/>

Offended, worth your laughter, hath giv’n up<br/>
Both his beloved Man and all his World,<br/>
To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us,<br/>
Without our hazard, labour or allarme,<br/>
To range in, and to dwell, and over Man<br/>
To rule, as over all he should have rul’d.<br/>
True is, mee also he hath judg’d, or rather<br/>
Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape<br/>
Man I deceav’d: that which to mee belongs,<br/>
Is enmity, which he will put between<br/>
Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel;<br/>
His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head:<br/>
A World who would not purchase with a bruise,<br/>

<p class="poem">
So having said, a while he stood, expecting<br/>
Thir universal shout and high applause<br/>
To fill his eare, when contrary he hears<br/>
On all sides, from innumerable tongues<br/>
A dismal universal hiss, the sound<br/>
Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long<br/>
Had leasure, wondring at himself now more;<br/>
His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare,<br/>
His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining<br/>
Each other, till supplanted down he fell<br/>
A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone,<br/>
Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power<br/>
Now rul’d him, punisht in the shape he sin’d,<br/>
According to his doom: he would have spoke,<br/>
But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue<br/>
To forked tongue, for now were all transform’d<br/>
Alike, to Serpents all as accessories<br/>
To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din<br/>
Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now<br/>
With complicated monsters, head and taile,<br/>
Scorpion and Asp, and <i>Amphisbaena</i> dire,<br/>
<i>Cerastes</i> hornd, <i>Hydrus</i>, and <i>Ellops</i> drear,<br/>
And <i>Dipsas</i> (Not so thick swarm’d once the Soil<br/>
Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle<br/>
<i>Ophiusa</i>) but still greatest hee the midst,<br/>
Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun<br/>
Ingenderd in the <i>Pythian</i> Vale on slime,<br/>
Huge <i>Python</i>, and his Power no less he seem’d<br/>
Above the rest still to retain; they all<br/>
Him follow’d issuing forth to th’ open Field,<br/>
Where all yet left of that revolted Rout<br/>
Heav’n-fall’n, in station stood or just array,<br/>
Sublime with expectation when to see<br/>
In Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief;<br/>
They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd<br/>
Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell,<br/>
And horrid sympathie; for what they saw,<br/>
They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms,<br/>
Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast,<br/>
And the dire hiss renew’d, and the dire form<br/>
Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment,<br/>
As in thir crime.  Thus was th’ applause they meant,<br/>
Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame<br/>
Cast on themselves from thir own mouths.  There stood<br/>
A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change,<br/>
His will who reigns above, to aggravate<br/>
Thir penance, laden with fair Fruit, like that<br/>
VVhich grew in Paradise, the bait of <i>Eve</i><br/>
Us’d by the Tempter: on that prospect strange<br/>
Thir earnest eyes they fix’d, imagining<br/>
For one forbidden Tree a multitude<br/>
Now ris’n, to work them furder woe or shame;<br/>
Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce,<br/>
Though to delude them sent, could not abstain,<br/>
But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees<br/>
Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks<br/>
That curld <i>Megaera</i>: greedily they pluck’d<br/>
The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew<br/>
Neer that bituminous Lake where <i>Sodom</i> flam’d;<br/>
This more delusive, not the touch, but taste<br/>
Deceav’d; they fondly thinking to allay<br/>
Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit<br/>
Chewd bitter Ashes, which th’ offended taste<br/>
VVith spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd,<br/>
Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft,<br/>
VVith hatefullest disrelish writh’d thir jaws<br/>
VVith foot and cinders fill’d; so oft they fell<br/>
Into the same illusion, not as Man<br/>
Whom they triumph’d once lapst.  Thus were they plagu’d<br/>
And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss,<br/>
Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum’d,<br/>
Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo<br/>
This annual humbling certain number’d days,<br/>
To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc’t.<br/>
However some tradition they dispers’d<br/>
Among the Heathen of thir purchase got,<br/>
And Fabl’d how the Serpent, whom they calld<br/>
<i>Ophion</i> with <i>Eurynome</i>, the wide-<br/>
Encroaching <i>Eve</i> perhaps, had first the rule<br/>
Of high <i>Olympus</i>, thence by <i>Saturn</i> driv’n<br/>
And <i>Ops</i>, ere yet <i>Dictaean</i> <i>Jove</i> was born.<br/>
Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair<br/>
Too soon arriv’d, <i>Sin</i> there in power before,<br/>
Once actual, now in body, and to dwell<br/>
Habitual habitant; behind her <i>Death</i><br/>
Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet<br/>
On his pale Horse: to whom <i>Sin</i> thus began.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Second of <i>Satan</i> sprung, all conquering Death,<br/>
What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd<br/>

Up to the <i>Tropic</i> Crab; thence down amaine<br/>

Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate?<br/>
These changes in the Heav’ns, though slow, produc’d<br/>

Daughter of Sin, among th’ irrational,<br/>

And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving,<br/>
Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe<br/>
Of Man, but fled him, or with count’nance grim<br/>
Glar’d on him passing: these were from without<br/>
The growing miseries, which <i>Adam</i> saw<br/>
Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,<br/>

O miserable of happie! is this the end<br/>

Of happiness: yet well, if here would end<br/>
The miserie, I deserv’d it, and would beare<br/>

Concurd not to my being, it were but right<br/>

Desirous to resigne, and render back<br/>
All I receav’d, unable to performe<br/>
Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold<br/>
The good I sought not.  To the loss of that,<br/>
Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added<br/>
The sense of endless woes? inexplicable<br/>
Thy Justice seems; yet to say truth, too late,<br/>
I thus contest; then should have been refusd<br/>
Those terms whatever, when they were propos’d:<br/>
Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good,<br/>
Then cavil the conditions? and though God<br/>
Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son<br/>
Prove disobedient, and reprov’d, retort,<br/>
Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not:<br/>
Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee<br/>
That proud excuse? yet him not thy election,<br/>
But Natural necessity begot.<br/>
God made thee of choice his own, and of his own<br/>
To serve him, thy reward was of his grace,<br/>
Thy punishment then justly is at his Will.<br/>
Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair,<br/>
That dust I am, and shall to dust returne:<br/>
O welcom hour whenever! why delayes<br/>
His hand to execute what his Decree<br/>
Fixd on this day? why do I overlive,<br/>
Why am I mockt with death, and length’nd out<br/>
To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet<br/>
Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth<br/>
Insensible, how glad would lay me down<br/>
As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest<br/>
And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more<br/>
Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse<br/>
To mee and to my ofspring would torment me<br/>
With cruel expectation.  Yet one doubt<br/>
Pursues me still, least all I cannot die,<br/>
Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man<br/>
Which God inspir’d, cannot together perish<br/>
With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave,<br/>
Or in some other dismal place, who knows<br/>
But I shall die a living Death?  O thought<br/>
Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath<br/>
Of Life that sinn’d; what dies but what had life<br/>
And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither.<br/>
All of me then shall die: let this appease<br/>
The doubt, since humane reach no further knows.<br/>
For though the Lord of all be infinite,<br/>
Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so,<br/>
But mortal doom’d.  How can he exercise<br/>
Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end?<br/>
Can he make deathless Death? that were to make<br/>
Strange contradiction, which to God himself<br/>
Impossible is held, as Argument<br/>
Of weakness, not of Power.  Will he, draw out,<br/>
For angers sake, finite to infinite<br/>
In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour<br/>
Satisfi’d never; that were to extend<br/>
His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law,<br/>
By which all Causes else according still<br/>
To the reception of thir matter act,<br/>
Not to th’ extent of thir own Spheare.  But say<br/>
That Death be not one stroak, as I suppos’d,<br/>
Bereaving sense, but endless miserie<br/>
From this day onward, which I feel begun<br/>
Both in me, and without me, and so last<br/>
To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear<br/>
Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution<br/>
On my defensless head; both Death and I<br/>
Am found Eternal, and incorporate both,<br/>
Nor I on my part single, in mee all<br/>
Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie<br/>
That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able<br/>
To waste it all my self, and leave ye none!<br/>
So disinherited how would ye bless<br/>
Me now your Curse!  Ah, why should all mankind<br/>
For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn’d,<br/>
If guiltless?  But from mee what can proceed,<br/>
But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav’d,<br/>
Not to do onely, but to will the same<br/>
With me? how can they acquitted stand<br/>
In sight of God?  Him after all Disputes<br/>
Forc’t I absolve: all my evasions vain<br/>
And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still<br/>
But to my own conviction: first and last<br/>
On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring<br/>
Of all corruption, all the blame lights due;<br/>
So might the wrauth, Fond wish! couldst thou support<br/>
That burden heavier then the Earth to bear,<br/>
Then all the world much heavier, though divided<br/>
With that bad Woman?  Thus what thou desir’st,<br/>
And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope<br/>
Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable<br/>
Beyond all past example and future,<br/>
To <i>Satan</i> onely like both crime and doom.<br/>
O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears<br/>
And horrors hast thou driv’n me; out of which<br/>
I find no way, from deep to deeper plung’d!<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thus <i>Adam</i> to himself lamented loud<br/>
Through the still Night, now now, as ere man fell,<br/>
Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air<br/>
Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom,<br/>
Which to his evil Conscience represented<br/>
All things with double terror: On the ground<br/>
Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft<br/>
Curs’d his Creation, Death as oft accus’d<br/>
Of tardie execution, since denounc’t<br/>
The day of his offence.  Why comes not Death,<br/>
Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke<br/>
To end me?  Shall Truth fail to keep her word,<br/>
Justice Divine not hast’n to be just?<br/>
But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine<br/>
Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries.<br/>
O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs,<br/>
VVith other echo farr I taught your Shades<br/>
To answer, and resound farr other Song.<br/>
VVhom thus afflicted when sad <i>Eve</i> beheld,<br/>
Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh,<br/>
Soft words to his fierce passion she assay’d:<br/>
But her with stern regard he thus repell’d.<br/>

Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best<br/>
Befits thee with him leagu’d, thy self as false<br/>
And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape,<br/>
Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew<br/>
Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee<br/>
Henceforth; least that too heav’nly form, pretended<br/>
To hellish falshood, snare them.  But for thee<br/>
I had persisted happie, had not thy pride<br/>
And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe,<br/>
Rejected my forewarning, and disdain’d<br/>
Not to be trusted, longing to be seen<br/>
Though by the Devil himself, him overweening<br/>
To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting<br/>
Fool’d and beguil’d, by him thou, I by thee,<br/>
To trust thee from my side, imagin’d wise,<br/>
Constant, mature, proof against all assaults,<br/>
And understood not all was but a shew<br/>
Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib<br/>
Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears,<br/>
More to the part sinister from me drawn,<br/>
Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie<br/>
To my just number found.  O why did God,<br/>
Creator wise, that peopl’d highest Heav’n<br/>
With Spirits Masculine, create at last<br/>
This noveltie on Earth, this fair defect<br/>
Of Nature, and not fill the World at once<br/>
With Men as Angels without Feminine,<br/>
Or find some other way to generate<br/>
Mankind? this mischief had not then befall’n,<br/>
And more that shall befall, innumerable<br/>
Disturbances on Earth through Femal snares,<br/>
And straight conjunction with this Sex: for either<br/>
He never shall find out fit Mate, but such<br/>
As some misfortune brings him, or mistake,<br/>
Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain<br/>
Through her perverseness, but shall see her gaind<br/>
By a farr worse, or if she love, withheld<br/>
By Parents, or his happiest choice too late<br/>
Shall meet, alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound<br/>
To a fell Adversarie, his hate or shame:<br/>
Which infinite calamitie shall cause<br/>
To humane life, and houshold peace confound.<br/>

He added not, and from her turn’d, but <i>Eve</i><br/>
Not so repulst, with Tears that ceas’d not flowing,<br/>

Forsake me not thus, <i>Adam</i>, witness Heav’n<br/>
What love sincere, and reverence in my heart<br/>

While yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps,<br/>

Towards her, his life so late and sole delight,<br/>
Now at his feet submissive in distress,<br/>
Creature so faire his reconcilement seeking,<br/>

His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part,<br/>
And my displeasure bearst so ill.  If Prayers<br/>
Could alter high Decrees, I to that place<br/>
Would speed before thee, and be louder heard,<br/>
That on my head all might be visited,<br/>
Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv’n,<br/>
To me committed and by me expos’d.<br/>
But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame<br/>
Each other, blam’d enough elsewhere, but strive<br/>
In offices of Love, how we may light’n<br/>
Each others burden in our share of woe;<br/>
Since this days Death denounc’t, if ought I see,<br/>
Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac’t evill,<br/>
A long days dying to augment our paine,<br/>
And to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) deriv’d.<br/>

To whom thus <i>Eve</i>, recovering heart, repli’d.<br/>
<i>Adam</i>, by sad experiment I know<br/>
How little weight my words with thee can finde,<br/>
Found so erroneous, thence by just event<br/>
Found so unfortunate; nevertheless,<br/>
Restor’d by thee, vile as I am, to place<br/>
Of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine<br/>
Thy Love, the sole contentment of my heart,<br/>
Living or dying from thee I will not hide<br/>
What thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris’n,<br/>
Tending to som relief of our extremes,<br/>
Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable,<br/>
As in our evils, and of easier choice.<br/>
If care of our descent perplex us most,<br/>
Which must be born to certain woe, devourd<br/>
By Death at last, and miserable it is<br/>
To be to others cause of misery,<br/>
Our own begotten, and of our Loines to bring<br/>
Into this cursed World a woful Race,<br/>
That after wretched Life must be at last<br/>
Food for so foule a Monster, in thy power<br/>
It lies, yet ere Conception to prevent<br/>
The Race unblest, to being yet unbegot.<br/>
Childless thou art, Childless remaine:<br/>
So Death shall be deceav’d his glut, and with us two<br/>
Be forc’d to satisfie his Rav’nous Maw.<br/>
But if thou judge it hard and difficult,<br/>
Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain<br/>
From Loves due Rites, Nuptial embraces sweet,<br/>
And with desire to languish without hope,<br/>
Before the present object languishing<br/>
With like desire, which would be miserie<br/>
And torment less then none of what we dread,<br/>
Then both our selves and Seed at once to free<br/>
From what we fear for both, let us make short,<br/>
Let us seek Death, or hee not found, supply<br/>
With our own hands his Office on our selves;<br/>
Why stand we longer shivering under feares,<br/>
That shew no end but Death, and have the power,<br/>
Of many wayes to die the shortest choosing,<br/>
Destruction with destruction to destroy.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
She ended heer, or vehement despaire<br/>
Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts<br/>
Had entertaind, as di’d her Cheeks with pale.<br/>
But <i>Adam</i> with such counsel nothing sway’d,<br/>
To better hopes his more attentive minde<br/>
Labouring had rais’d, and thus to <i>Eve</i> repli’d.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
<i>Eve</i>, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems<br/>
To argue in thee somthing more sublime<br/>
And excellent then what thy minde contemnes;<br/>
But self-destruction therefore saught, refutes<br/>
That excellence thought in thee, and implies,<br/>
Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret<br/>
For loss of life and pleasure overlov’d.<br/>
Or if thou covet death, as utmost end<br/>
Of miserie, so thinking to evade<br/>
The penaltie pronounc’t, doubt not but God<br/>
Hath wiselier arm’d his vengeful ire then so<br/>
To be forestall’d; much more I fear least Death<br/>
So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine<br/>
We are by doom to pay; rather such acts<br/>
Of contumacie will provoke the highest<br/>
To make death in us live: Then let us seek<br/>
Som safer resolution, which methinks<br/>
I have in view, calling to minde with heed<br/>
Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise<br/>
The Serpents head; piteous amends, unless<br/>
Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe<br/>
<i>Satan</i>, who in the Serpent hath contriv’d<br/>
Against us this deceit: to crush his head<br/>
Would be revenge indeed; which will be lost<br/>
By death brought on our selves, or childless days<br/>
Resolv’d, as thou proposest; so our Foe<br/>
Shall scape his punishment ordain’d, and wee<br/>
Instead shall double ours upon our heads.<br/>
No more be mention’d then of violence<br/>
Against our selves, and wilful barrenness,<br/>
That cuts us off from hope, and savours onely<br/>
Rancor and pride, impatience and despite,<br/>
Reluctance against God and his just yoke<br/>
Laid on our Necks.  Remember with what mild<br/>
And gracious temper he both heard and judg’d<br/>
Without wrauth or reviling; wee expected<br/>
Immediate dissolution, which we thought<br/>
Was meant by Death that day, when lo, to thee<br/>
Pains onely in Child-bearing were foretold,<br/>
And bringing forth, soon recompenc’t with joy,<br/>
Fruit of thy Womb: On mee the Curse aslope<br/>
Glanc’d on the ground, with labour I must earne<br/>
My bread; what harm?  Idleness had bin worse;<br/>
My labour will sustain me; and least Cold<br/>
Or Heat should injure us, his timely care<br/>
Hath unbesaught provided, and his hands<br/>
Cloath’d us unworthie, pitying while he judg’d;<br/>
How much more, if we pray him, will his ear<br/>
Be open, and his heart to pitie incline,<br/>
And teach us further by what means to shun<br/>
Th’ inclement Seasons, Rain, Ice, Hail and Snow,<br/>
Which now the Skie with various Face begins<br/>
To shew us in this Mountain, while the Winds<br/>
Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks<br/>
Of these fair spreading Trees; which bids us seek<br/>
Som better shroud, som better warmth to cherish<br/>
Our Limbs benumm’d, ere this diurnal Starr<br/>
Leave cold the Night, how we his gather’d beams<br/>
Reflected, may with matter sere foment,<br/>
Or by collision of two bodies grinde<br/>
The Air attrite to Fire, as late the Clouds<br/>
Justling or pusht with Winds rude in thir shock<br/>
Tine the slant Lightning, whose thwart flame driv’n down<br/>
Kindles the gummie bark of Firr or Pine,<br/>
And sends a comfortable heat from farr,<br/>
Which might supplie the Sun: such Fire to use,<br/>
And what may else be remedie or cure<br/>
To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought,<br/>
Hee will instruct us praying, and of Grace<br/>
Beseeching him, so as we need not fear<br/>
To pass commodiously this life, sustain’d<br/>
By him with many comforts, till we end<br/>
In dust, our final rest and native home.<br/>
What better can we do, then to the place<br/>
Repairing where he judg’d us, prostrate fall<br/>
Before him reverent, and there confess<br/>
Humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears<br/>
VVatering the ground, and with our sighs the Air<br/>
Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign<br/>
Of sorrow unfeign’d, and humiliation meek.<br/>
Undoubtedly he will relent and turn<br/>
From his displeasure; in whose look serene,<br/>
VVhen angry most he seem’d and most severe,<br/>
VVhat else but favor, grace, and mercie shon?<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake our Father penitent, nor <i>Eve</i><br/>
Felt less remorse: they forthwith to the place<br/>
Repairing where he judg’d them prostrate fell<br/>
Before him reverent, and both confess’d<br/>
Humbly thir faults, and pardon beg’d, with tears<br/>
VVatering the ground, and with thir sighs the Air<br/>
Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign<br/>
Of sorrow unfeign’d, and humiliation meek.<br/>

The good which we enjoy, from Heav’n descends<br/>
But that from us ought should ascend to Heav’n<br/>
So prevalent as to concerne the mind<br/>
Of God high blest, or to incline his will,<br/>
Hard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer,<br/>
Or one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne<br/>
Ev’n to the Seat of God.  For since I saught<br/>
By Prayer th’ offended Deitie to appease,<br/>
Kneel’d and before him humbl’d all my heart,<br/>
Methought I saw him placable and mild,<br/>
Bending his eare; perswasion in me grew<br/>
That I was heard with favour; peace returnd<br/>
Home to my brest, and to my memorie<br/>
His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe;<br/>
Which then not minded in dismay, yet now<br/>
Assures me that the bitterness of death<br/>
Is past, and we shall live.  Whence Haile to thee,<br/>
<i>Eve</i> rightly call’d, Mother of all Mankind,<br/>
Mother of all things living, since by thee<br/>
Man is to live, and all things live for Man.<br/>

To whom thus <i>Eve</i> with sad demeanour meek.<br/>
Ill worthie I such title should belong<br/>
To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind<br/>
A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach<br/>
Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise:<br/>
But infinite in pardon was my Judge,<br/>
That I who first brought Death on all, am grac’t<br/>
The sourse of life; next favourable thou,<br/>
Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf’t,<br/>
Farr other name deserving.  But the Field<br/>
To labour calls us now with sweat impos’d,<br/>
Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn,<br/>
All unconcern’d with our unrest, begins<br/>
Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth,<br/>
I never from thy side henceforth to stray,<br/>
Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind<br/>
Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell,<br/>
What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes?<br/>
Here let us live, though in fall’n state, content.<br/>

Subscrib’d not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest<br/>
On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips’d<br/>
After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight<br/>
The Bird of <i>Jove</i>, stoopt from his aerie tour,<br/>
Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove:<br/>
Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods,<br/>
First Hunter then, pursu’d a gentle brace,<br/>
Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde;<br/>
Direct to th’ Eastern Gate was bent thir flight.<br/>
<i>Adam</i> observ’d, and with his Eye the chase<br/>
Pursuing, not unmov’d to <i>Eve</i> thus spake.<br/>

<p class="poem">
O <i>Eve</i>, some furder change awaits us nigh,<br/>
Which Heav’n by these mute signs in Nature shews<br/>
Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn<br/>
Us haply too secure of our discharge<br/>
From penaltie, because from death releast<br/>
Some days; how long, and what till then our life,<br/>
Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust,<br/>
And thither must return and be no more.<br/>
VVhy else this double object in our sight<br/>
Of flight pursu’d in th’ Air and ore the ground<br/>
One way the self-same hour? why in the East<br/>
Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light<br/>
More orient in yon VVestern Cloud that draws<br/>
O’re the blew Firmament a radiant white,<br/>
And slow descends, with somthing heav’nly fraught.<br/>

<p class="poem">
He err’d not, for by this the heav’nly Bands<br/>
Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now<br/>
In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt,<br/>
A glorious Apparition, had not doubt<br/>
And carnal fear that day dimm’d <i>Adams</i> eye.<br/>
Not that more glorious, when the Angels met<br/>
<i>Jacob</i> in <i>Mahanaim</i>, where he saw<br/>
The field Pavilion’d with his Guardians bright;<br/>
Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd<br/>
In <i>Dothan</i>, cover’d with a Camp of Fire,<br/>
Against the <i>Syrian</i> King, who to surprize<br/>
One man, Assassin-like had levied Warr,<br/>
Warr unproclam’d.  The Princely Hierarch<br/>
In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise<br/>
Possession of the Garden; hee alone,<br/>
To finde where <i>Adam</i> shelterd, took his way,<br/>
Not unperceav’d of <i>Adam</i>, who to <i>Eve</i>,<br/>
While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
<i>Eve</i>, now expect great tidings, which perhaps<br/>
Of us will soon determin, or impose<br/>
New Laws to be observ’d; for I descrie<br/>
From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill<br/>
One of the heav’nly Host, and by his Gate<br/>
None of the meanest, some great Potentate<br/>
Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie<br/>
Invests him coming; yet not terrible,<br/>
That I should fear, nor sociably mild,<br/>
As <i>Raphael</i>, that I should much confide,<br/>
But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend,<br/>
With reverence I must meet, and thou retire.<br/>
He ended; and th’ Arch-Angel soon drew nigh,<br/>
Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man<br/>
Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes<br/>
A militarie Vest of purple flowd<br/>
Livelier then <i>Meliboean</i>, or the graine<br/>
Of <i>Sarra</i>, worn by Kings and Hero’s old<br/>
In time of Truce; <i>Iris</i> had dipt the wooff;<br/>
His starrie Helme unbuckl’d shew’d him prime<br/>
In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side<br/>
As in a glistering <i>Zodiac</i> hung the Sword,<br/>
Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear.<br/>
<i>Adam</i> bowd low, hee Kingly from his State<br/>
Inclin’d not, but his coming thus declar’d.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
<i>Adam</i>, Heav’ns high behest no Preface needs:<br/>
Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death,<br/>
Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress,<br/>
Defeated of his seisure many dayes<br/>
Giv’n thee of Grace, wherein thou may’st repent,<br/>
And one bad act with many deeds well done<br/>
Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas’d<br/>
Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claimes;<br/>
But longer in this Paradise to dwell<br/>
Permits not; to remove thee I am come,<br/>
And send thee from the Garden forth to till<br/>
The ground whence thou wast tak’n, fitter Soile.<br/>

He added not, for <i>Adam</i> at the newes<br/>
Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,<br/>
That all his senses bound; <i>Eve</i>, who unseen<br/>

Discover’d soon the place of her retire.<br/>

O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death!<br/>
Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave<br/>
Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades,<br/>
Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend,<br/>
Quiet though sad, the respit of that day<br/>
That must be mortal to us both.  O flours,<br/>
That never will in other Climate grow,<br/>
My early visitation, and my last<br/>
At Eev’n, which I bred up with tender hand<br/>
From the first op’ning bud, and gave ye Names,<br/>
Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke<br/>
Your Tribes, and water from th’ ambrosial Fount?<br/>
Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd<br/>
With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee<br/>
How shall I part, and whither wander down<br/>
Into a lower World, to this obscure<br/>
And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire<br/>
Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits?<br/>

Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem<br/>
Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould<br/>
Thy message, which might else in telling wound,<br/>
And in performing end us; what besides<br/>
Of sorrow and dejection and despair<br/>
Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring,<br/>
Departure from this happy place, our sweet<br/>
Recess, and onely consolation left<br/>
Familiar to our eyes, all places else<br/>
Inhospitable appeer and desolate,<br/>
Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer<br/>
Incessant I could hope to change the will<br/>
Of him who all things can, I would not cease<br/>
To wearie him with my assiduous cries:<br/>
But prayer against his absolute Decree<br/>
No more availes then breath against the winde,<br/>
Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth:<br/>
Therefore to his great bidding I submit.<br/>
This most afflicts me, that departing hence,<br/>
As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd<br/>
His blessed count’nance; here I could frequent,<br/>
With worship, place by place where he voutsaf’d<br/>
Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate;<br/>
On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree<br/>
Stood visible, among these Pines his voice<br/>
I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk’d:<br/>
So many grateful Altars I would reare<br/>
Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone<br/>
Of lustre from the brook, in memorie,<br/>
Or monument to Ages, and thereon<br/>
Offer sweet smelling Gumms &amp; Fruits and Flours:<br/>
In yonder nether World where shall I seek<br/>
His bright appearances, or footstep trace?<br/>
For though I fled him angrie, yet recall’d<br/>
To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now<br/>
Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts<br/>
Of glory, and farr off his steps adore.<br/>

To whom thus <i>Michael</i> with regard benigne.<br/>

Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills<br/>
Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives,<br/>
Fomented by his virtual power and warmd:<br/>
All th’ Earth he gave thee to possess and rule,<br/>
No despicable gift; surmise not then<br/>
His presence to these narrow bounds confin’d<br/>
Of Paradise or <i>Eden</i>: this had been<br/>
Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred<br/>
All generations, and had hither come<br/>
From all the ends of th’ Earth, to celebrate<br/>
And reverence thee thir great Progenitor.<br/>
But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down<br/>
To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons:<br/>
Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in Plaine<br/>
God is as here, and will be found alike<br/>
Present, and of his presence many a signe<br/>
Still following thee, still compassing thee round<br/>
With goodness and paternal Love, his Face<br/>
Express, and of his steps the track Divine.<br/>
Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd,<br/>
Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent<br/>
To shew thee what shall come in future dayes<br/>
To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad<br/>
Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending<br/>
With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn<br/>
True patience, and to temper joy with fear<br/>
And pious sorrow, equally enur’d<br/>
By moderation either state to beare,<br/>
Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead<br/>
Safest thy life, and best prepar’d endure<br/>
Thy mortal passage when it comes.  Ascend<br/>
This Hill; let <i>Eve</i> (for I have drencht her eyes)<br/>
Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak’st,<br/>
As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd.<br/>

My obvious breast, arming to overcom<br/>
By suffering, and earne rest from labour won,<br/>
If so I may attain.  So both ascend<br/>
In the Visions of God:  It was a Hill<br/>
Of Paradise the highest, from whose top<br/>
The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken<br/>
Stretcht out to amplest reach of prospect lay.<br/>
Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round,<br/>
Whereon for different cause the Tempter set<br/>
Our second <i>Adam</i> in the Wilderness,<br/>

His Eye might there command wherever stood<br/>
City of old or modern Fame, the Seat<br/>
Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls<br/>
Of <i>Cambalu</i>, seat of <i>Cathaian Can</i><br/>

On <i>Europe</i> thence, and where <i>Rome</i> was to sway<br/>

Rich <i>Mexico</i> the seat of <i>Motezume</i>,<br/>
And <i>Cusco</i> in <i>Peru</i>, the richer seat<br/>
Of <i>Atabalipa</i>, and yet unspoil’d<br/>

<i>Michael</i> from <i>Adams</i> eyes the Filme remov’d<br/>
VVhich that false Fruit that promis’d clearer sight<br/>
Had bred; then purg’d with Euphrasie and Rue<br/>
The visual Nerve, for he had much to see;<br/>
And from the VVell of Life three drops instill’d.<br/>
So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc’d,<br/>
Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight,<br/>
That <i>Adam</i> now enforc’t to close his eyes,<br/>
Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst:<br/>

Soon rais’d, and his attention thus recall’d.<br/>

Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon<br/>
A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought<br/>
First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf,<br/>
Uncull’d, as came to hand; a Shepherd next<br/>
More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock<br/>
Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid<br/>
The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew’d,<br/>
On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform’d.<br/>

More terrible at th’ entrance then within.<br/>
Some, as thou saw’st, by violent stroke shall die,<br/>
By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more<br/>
In Meats and Drinks, which on the Earth shal bring<br/>
Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew<br/>
Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know<br/>
What miserie th’ inabstinence of <i>Eve</i><br/>
Shall bring on men.  Immediately a place<br/>

So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop<br/>

Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds<br/>
Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound<br/>
Of Instruments that made melodious chime<br/>
Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd<br/>
Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch<br/>
Instinct through all proportions low and high<br/>
Fled and pursu’d transverse the resonant fugue.<br/>
In other part stood one who at the Forge<br/>
Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass<br/>
Had melted (whether found where casual fire<br/>
Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale,<br/>
Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot<br/>
To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream<br/>
From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind<br/>
Into fit moulds prepar’d; from which he formd<br/>
First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought<br/>
Fulfil or grav’n in mettle.  After these,<br/>
But on the hether side a different sort<br/>
From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat,<br/>
Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise<br/>
Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent<br/>
To worship God aright, and know his works<br/>
Not hid, nor those things lost which might preserve<br/>
Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain<br/>
Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold<br/>
A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay<br/>
In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung<br/>
Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on:<br/>
The Men though grave, ey’d them, and let thir eyes<br/>
Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net<br/>
Fast caught, they lik’d, and each his liking chose;<br/>
And now of love they treat till th’ Eevning Star<br/>
Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat<br/>
They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke<br/>
Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok’t;<br/>
With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound.<br/>
Such happy interview and fair event<br/>
Of love &amp; youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours,<br/>
And charming Symphonies attach’d the heart<br/>

Inhumanly to men, and multiply<br/>
Ten thousand fould the sin of him who slew<br/>
His Brother; for of whom such massacher<br/>
Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men?<br/>
But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav’n<br/>
Rescu’d, had in his Righteousness bin lost?<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
To whom thus <i>Michael</i>; These are the product<br/>
Of those ill-mated Marriages thou saw’st;<br/>
Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves<br/>
Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt,<br/>
Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind.<br/>
Such were these Giants, men of high renown;<br/>
For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir’d,<br/>
And Valour and Heroic Vertu call’d;<br/>
To overcome in Battel, and subdue<br/>
Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite<br/>
Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch<br/>
Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done<br/>
Of triumph, to be styl’d great Conquerours,<br/>
Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods,<br/>
Destroyers rightlier call’d and Plagues of men.<br/>
Thus Fame shall be achiev’d, renown on Earth,<br/>
And what most merits fame in silence hid.<br/>
But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst<br/>
The onely righteous in a World perverse,<br/>
And therefore hated, therefore so beset<br/>
With Foes for daring single to be just,<br/>
And utter odious Truth, that God would come<br/>
To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High<br/>
Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds<br/>
Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God<br/>
High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss,<br/>
Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward<br/>
Awaits the good, the rest what punishment;<br/>
Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold.<br/>

He look’d, &amp; saw the face of things quite chang’d;<br/>
The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar,<br/>
All now was turn’d to jollitie and game,<br/>
To luxurie and riot, feast and dance,<br/>
Marrying or prostituting, as befell,<br/>
Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire<br/>
Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles.<br/>
At length a Reverend Sire among them came,<br/>
And of thir doings great dislike declar’d,<br/>
And testifi’d against thir wayes; hee oft<br/>
Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met,<br/>
Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd<br/>
Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls<br/>
In prison under Judgements imminent:<br/>
But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas’d<br/>
Contending, and remov’d his Tents farr off;<br/>
Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall,<br/>
Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk,<br/>
Measur’d by Cubit, length, &amp; breadth, and highth,<br/>
Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore<br/>
Contriv’d, and of provisions laid in large<br/>
For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange!<br/>
Of everie Beast, and Bird, and Insect small<br/>
Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught<br/>
Thir order; last the Sire, and his three Sons<br/>
With thir four Wives, and God made fast the dore.<br/>
Meanwhile the Southwind rose, &amp; with black wings<br/>
Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove<br/>
From under Heav’n; the Hills to their supplie<br/>
Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist,<br/>
Sent up amain; and now the thick’nd Skie<br/>
Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush’d the Rain<br/>
Impetuous, and continu’d till the Earth<br/>
No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum<br/>
Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow<br/>
Rode tilting o’re the Waves, all dwellings else<br/>
Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp<br/>
Deep under water rould; Sea cover’d Sea,<br/>
Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces<br/>
Where luxurie late reign’d, Sea-monsters whelp’d<br/>
And stabl’d; of Mankind, so numerous late,<br/>
All left, in one small bottom swum imbark’t.<br/>
How didst thou grieve then, <i>Adam</i>, to behold<br/>
The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad,<br/>
Depopulation; thee another Floud,<br/>
Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown’d,<br/>
And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard<br/>
By th’ Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last,<br/>
Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns<br/>
His Childern, all in view destroyd at once;<br/>
And scarce to th’ Angel utterdst thus thy plaint.<br/>

O Visions ill foreseen! better had I<br/>
Liv’d ignorant of future, so had borne<br/>
My part of evil onely, each dayes lot<br/>
Anough to bear; those now, that were dispenst<br/>
The burd’n of many Ages, on me light<br/>
At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth<br/>
Abortive, to torment me ere thir being,<br/>
With thought that they must be.  Let no man seek<br/>
Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall<br/>
Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure,<br/>
Which neither his foreknowing can prevent,<br/>
And hee the future evil shall no less<br/>
In apprehension then in substance feel<br/>
Grievous to bear: but that care now is past,<br/>
Man is not whom to warne: those few escap’t<br/>
Famin and anguish will at last consume<br/>
Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope<br/>
When violence was ceas’t, and Warr on Earth,<br/>
All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd<br/>
With length of happy days the race of man;<br/>
But I was farr deceav’d; for now I see<br/>
Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste.<br/>
How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide,<br/>
And whether here the Race of man will end.<br/>
To whom thus <i>Michael</i>.  Those whom last thou sawst<br/>
In triumph and luxurious wealth, are they<br/>
First seen in acts of prowess eminent<br/>
And great exploits, but of true vertu void;<br/>
Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste<br/>
Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby<br/>
Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey,<br/>
Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth,<br/>
Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride<br/>
Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace.<br/>
The conquerd also, and enslav’d by Warr<br/>
Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose<br/>
And feare of God, from whom thir pietie feign’d<br/>
In sharp contest of Battel found no aide<br/>
Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale<br/>
Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure,<br/>
Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords<br/>
Shall leave them to enjoy; for th’ Earth shall bear<br/>
More then anough, that temperance may be tri’d:<br/>
So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav’d,<br/>
Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot;<br/>
One Man except, the onely Son of light<br/>
In a dark Age, against example good,<br/>
Against allurement, custom, and a World<br/>
Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn,<br/>
Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes<br/>
Shall them admonish, and before them set<br/>
The paths of righteousness, how much more safe,<br/>
And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come<br/>
On thir impenitence; and shall returne<br/>
Of them derided, but of God observd<br/>
The one just Man alive; by his command<br/>
Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst,<br/>
To save himself and houshold from amidst<br/>
A World devote to universal rack.<br/>
No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast<br/>
Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg’d,<br/>
And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts<br/>
Of Heav’n set open on the Earth shall powre<br/>
Raine day and night, all fountaines of the Deep<br/>
Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp<br/>
Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise<br/>
Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount<br/>
Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd<br/>
Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud,<br/>
With all his verdure spoil’d, and Trees adrift<br/>
Down the great River to the op’ning Gulf,<br/>
And there take root an Iland salt and bare,<br/>
The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang.<br/>
To teach thee that God attributes to place<br/>
No sanctitie, if none be thither brought<br/>
By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell.<br/>
And now what further shall ensue, behold.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud,<br/>
Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled,<br/>
Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie<br/>
Wrinkl’d the face of Deluge, as decai’d;<br/>
And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass<br/>
Gaz’d hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew,<br/>
As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink<br/>
From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole<br/>
With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt<br/>
His Sluces, as the Heav’n his windows shut.<br/>
The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground<br/>
Fast on the top of som high mountain fixt.<br/>
And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer;<br/>
With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive<br/>
Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde.<br/>
Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies,<br/>
And after him, the surer messenger,<br/>
A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie<br/>
Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light;<br/>
The second time returning, in his Bill<br/>
An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe:<br/>
Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke<br/>
The ancient Sire descends with all his Train;<br/>
Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout,<br/>
Grateful to Heav’n, over his head beholds<br/>
A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow<br/>
Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay,<br/>
Betok’ning peace from God, and Cov’nant new.<br/>

Greatly rejoyc’d, and thus his joy broke forth.<br/>

O thou that future things canst represent<br/>

Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce<br/>
For one Man found so perfet and so just,<br/>
That God voutsafes to raise another World<br/>
From him, and all his anger to forget.<br/>
But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn,<br/>
Distended as the Brow of God appeas’d,<br/>
Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde<br/>
The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud,<br/>

To whom th’ Archangel.  Dextrously thou aim’st;<br/>
So willingly doth God remit his Ire,<br/>
Though late repenting him of Man deprav’d,<br/>
Griev’d at his heart, when looking down he saw<br/>
The whole Earth fill’d with violence, and all flesh<br/>
Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov’d,<br/>
Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight,<br/>
That he relents, not to blot out mankind,<br/>
And makes a Covenant never to destroy<br/>
The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea<br/>
Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World<br/>
With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings<br/>
Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set<br/>
His triple-colour’d Bow, whereon to look<br/>
And call to mind his Cov’nant: Day and Night,<br/>
Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost<br/>
Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new,<br/>
Both Heav’n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.<br/>
Thus thou hast seen one World begin and end;<br/>
And Man as from a second stock proceed.<br/>
Much thou hast yet to see, but I perceave<br/>
Thy mortal sight to faile; objects divine<br/>
Must needs impaire and wearie human sense:<br/>
Henceforth what is to com I will relate,<br/>

This second sours of Men, while yet but few,<br/>
And while the dread of judgement past remains<br/>
Fresh in thir mindes, fearing the Deitie,<br/>
With some regard to what is just and right<br/>
Shall lead thir lives, and multiplie apace,<br/>
Labouring the soile, and reaping plenteous crop,<br/>
Corn wine and oyle; and from the herd or flock,<br/>
Oft sacrificing Bullock, Lamb, or Kid,<br/>
With large Wine-offerings pour’d, and sacred Feast<br/>
Shal spend thir dayes in joy unblam’d, and dwell<br/>
Long time in peace by Families and Tribes<br/>
Under paternal rule; till one shall rise<br/>
Of proud ambitious heart, who not content<br/>
With fair equalitie, fraternal state,<br/>
Will arrogate Dominion undeserv’d<br/>
Over his brethren, and quite dispossess<br/>
Concord and law of Nature from the Earth;<br/>
Hunting (and Men not Beasts shall be his game)<br/>
With Warr and hostile snare such as refuse<br/>
Subjection to his Empire tyrannous:<br/>
A mightie Hunter thence he shall be styl’d<br/>
Before the Lord, as in despite of Heav’n,<br/>
Or from Heav’n claming second Sovrantie;<br/>
And from Rebellion shall derive his name,<br/>
Though of Rebellion others he accuse.<br/>
Hee with a crew, whom like Ambition joyns<br/>
With him or under him to tyrannize,<br/>
Marching from <i>Eden</i> towards the West, shall finde<br/>
The Plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge<br/>
Boiles out from under ground, the mouth of Hell;<br/>
Of Brick, and of that stuff they cast to build<br/>
A Citie &amp; Towre, whose top may reach to Heav’n;<br/>
And get themselves a name, least far disperst<br/>
In foraign Lands thir memorie be lost,<br/>
Regardless whether good or evil fame.<br/>
But God who oft descends to visit men<br/>
Unseen, and through thir habitations walks<br/>
To mark thir doings, them beholding soon,<br/>
Comes down to see thir Citie, ere the Tower<br/>
Obstruct Heav’n Towrs, and in derision sets<br/>
Upon thir Tongues a various Spirit to rase<br/>
Quite out thir Native Language, and instead<br/>
To sow a jangling noise of words unknown:<br/>
Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud<br/>
Among the Builders; each to other calls<br/>
Not understood, till hoarse, and all in rage,<br/>
As mockt they storm; great laughter was in Heav’n<br/>
And looking down, to see the hubbub strange<br/>
And hear the din; thus was the building left<br/>
Ridiculous, and the work Confusion nam’d.<br/>

<p class="poem">
Whereto thus <i>Adam</i> fatherly displeas’d.<br/>
O execrable Son so to aspire<br/>
Above his Brethren, to himself affirming<br/>
Authoritie usurpt, from God not giv’n:<br/>
He gave us onely over Beast, Fish, Fowl<br/>
Dominion absolute; that right we hold<br/>
By his donation; but Man over men<br/>
He made not Lord; such title to himself<br/>
Reserving, human left from human free.<br/>
But this Usurper his encroachment proud<br/>
Stayes not on Man; to God his Tower intends<br/>
Siege and defiance: Wretched man! what food<br/>
Will he convey up thither to sustain<br/>
Himself and his rash Armie, where thin Aire<br/>
Above the Clouds will pine his entrails gross,<br/>
And famish him of Breath, if not of Bread?<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
To whom thus <i>Michael</i>.  Justly thou abhorr’st<br/>
That Son, who on the quiet state of men<br/>
Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue<br/>
Rational Libertie; yet know withall,<br/>
Since thy original lapse, true Libertie<br/>
Is lost, which alwayes with right Reason dwells<br/>
Twinn’d, and from her hath no dividual being:<br/>
Reason in man obscur’d, or not obeyd,<br/>
Immediately inordinate desires<br/>
And upstart Passions catch the Government<br/>
From Reason, and to servitude reduce<br/>
Man till then free.  Therefore since hee permits<br/>
Within himself unworthie Powers to reign<br/>
Over free Reason, God in Judgement just<br/>
Subjects him from without to violent Lords;<br/>
Who oft as undeservedly enthrall<br/>
His outward freedom: Tyrannie must be,<br/>
Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse.<br/>
Yet somtimes Nations will decline so low<br/>
From vertue, which is reason, that no wrong,<br/>
But Justice, and some fatal curse annext<br/>
Deprives them of thir outward libertie,<br/>
Thir inward lost: Witness th’ irreverent Son<br/>
Of him who built the Ark, who for the shame<br/>
Don to his Father, heard this heavie curse,<br/>
<i>Servant of Servants</i>, on his vitious Race.<br/>
Thus will this latter, as the former World,<br/>
Still tend from bad to worse, till God at last<br/>
Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw<br/>
His presence from among them, and avert<br/>
His holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth<br/>
To leave them to thir own polluted wayes;<br/>
And one peculiar Nation to select<br/>
From all the rest, of whom to be invok’d,<br/>
A Nation from one faithful man to spring:<br/>
Him on this side <i>Euphrates</i> yet residing,<br/>
Bred up in Idol-worship; O that men<br/>
(Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown,<br/>
While yet the Patriark liv’d, who scap’d the Flood,<br/>
As to forsake the living God, and fall<br/>
To-worship thir own work in Wood and Stone<br/>
For Gods! yet him God the most High voutsafes<br/>
To call by Vision from his Fathers house,<br/>
His kindred and false Gods, into a Land<br/>
Which he will shew him, and from him will raise<br/>
A mightie Nation, and upon him showre<br/>
His benediction so, that in his Seed<br/>
All Nations shall be blest; hee straight obeys,<br/>
Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes:<br/>
I see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith<br/>
He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soile<br/>
<i>Ur</i> of <i>Chaldaea</i>, passing now the Ford<br/>
To <i>Haran</i>, after him a cumbrous Train<br/>
Of Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude;<br/>
Not wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth<br/>
With God, who call’d him, in a land unknown.<br/>
<i>Canaan</i> he now attains, I see his Tents<br/>
Pitcht about <i>Sechem</i>, and the neighbouring Plaine<br/>
Of <i>Moreb</i> there by promise he receaves<br/>
Gift to his Progenie of all that Land;<br/>
From <i>Hamath</i> Northward to the Desert South<br/>
(Things by thir names I call, though yet unnam’d)<br/>
From <i>Hermon</i> East to the great Western Sea,<br/>
Mount <i>Hermon</i>, yonder Sea, each place behold<br/>
In prospect, as I point them; on the shoare<br/>
Mount <i>Carmel</i>; here the double-founted stream<br/>
<i>Jordan</i>, true limit Eastward; but his Sons<br/>
Shall dwell to <i>Senir</i>, that long ridge of Hills.<br/>
This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth<br/>
Shall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed<br/>
Is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise<br/>
The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon<br/>
Plainlier shall be reveald.  This Patriarch blest,<br/>
Whom <i>Faithful Abraham</i> due time shall call,<br/>
A Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves,<br/>
Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown;<br/>
The Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast, departs<br/>
From <i>Canaan</i>, to a Land hereafter call’d<br/>
<i>Egypt</i>, divided by the River <i>Nile</i>;<br/>
See where it flows, disgorging at seaven mouthes<br/>
Into the Sea: to sojourn in that Land<br/>
He comes invited by a yonger Son<br/>
In time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds<br/>
Raise him to be the second in that Realme<br/>
Of <i>Pharao</i>: there he dies, and leaves his Race<br/>
Growing into a Nation, and now grown<br/>
Suspected to a sequent King, who seeks<br/>
To stop thir overgrowth, as inmate guests<br/>
Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves<br/>
Inhospitably, and kills thir infant Males:<br/>
Till by two brethren (those two brethren call<br/>
<i>Moses</i> and <i>Aaron</i>) sent from God to claime<br/>
His people from enthralment, they return<br/>
With glory and spoile back to thir promis’d Land.<br/>
But first the lawless Tyrant, who denies<br/>
To know thir God, or message to regard,<br/>
Must be compelld by Signes and Judgements dire;<br/>
To blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd,<br/>
Frogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill<br/>
With loath’d intrusion, and fill all the land;<br/>
His Cattel must of Rot and Murren die,<br/>
Botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss,<br/>
And all his people; Thunder mixt with Haile,<br/>
Haile mixt with fire must rend th’ <i>Egyptian</i> Skie<br/>
And wheel on th’ Earth, devouring where it rouls;<br/>
What it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Graine,<br/>
A darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming down<br/>
Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green:<br/>
Darkness must overshadow all his bounds,<br/>
Palpable darkness, and blot out three dayes;<br/>
Last with one midnight stroke all the first-born<br/>
Of <i>Egypt</i> must lie dead.  Thus with ten wounds<br/>
This River-dragon tam’d at length submits<br/>
To let his sojourners depart, and oft<br/>
Humbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice<br/>
More hard’nd after thaw, till in his rage<br/>
Pursuing whom he late dismissd, the Sea<br/>
Swallows him with his Host, but them lets pass<br/>
As on drie land between two christal walls,<br/>
Aw’d by the rod of <i>Moses</i> so to stand<br/>
Divided, till his rescu’d gain thir shoar:<br/>
Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend,<br/>
Though present in his Angel, who shall goe<br/>
Before them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire,<br/>
To guide them in thir journey, and remove<br/>
Behinde them, while th’ obdurat King pursues:<br/>
All night he will pursue, but his approach<br/>
Darkness defends between till morning Watch;<br/>
Then through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud<br/>
God looking forth will trouble all his Host<br/>
And craze thir Chariot wheels: when by command<br/>
<i>Moses</i> once more his potent Rod extends<br/>
Over the Sea; the Sea his Rod obeys;<br/>
On thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return,<br/>
And overwhelm thir Warr: the Race elect<br/>
Safe towards <i>Canaan</i> from the shoar advance<br/>
Through the wilde Desert, not the readiest way,<br/>
Least entring on the <i>Canaanite</i> allarmd<br/>
Warr terrifie them inexpert, and feare<br/>
Return them back to <i>Egypt</i>, choosing rather<br/>
Inglorious life with servitude; for life<br/>
To noble and ignoble is more sweet<br/>
Untraind in Armes, where rashness leads not on.<br/>
This also shall they gain by thir delay<br/>
In the wide Wilderness, there they shall found<br/>
Thir government, and thir great Senate choose<br/>
Through the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordaind:<br/>
God from the Mount of <i>Sinai</i>, whose gray top<br/>
Shall tremble, he descending, will himself<br/>
In Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound<br/>
Ordaine them Lawes; part such as appertaine<br/>
To civil Justice, part religious Rites<br/>
Of sacrifice, informing them, by types<br/>
And shadowes, of that destind Seed to bruise<br/>
The Serpent, by what meanes he shall achieve<br/>
Mankinds deliverance.  But the voice of God<br/>
To mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech<br/>
That <i>Moses</i> might report to them his will,<br/>
And terror cease; he grants them thir desire,<br/>
Instructed that to God is no access<br/>
Without Mediator, whose high Office now<br/>
<i>Moses</i> in figure beares, to introduce<br/>
One greater, of whose day he shall foretell,<br/>
And all the Prophets in thir Age the times<br/>
Of great <i>Messiah</i> shall sing.  Thus Laws and Rites<br/>
Establisht, such delight hath God in Men<br/>
Obedient to his will, that he voutsafes<br/>
Among them to set up his Tabernacle,<br/>
The holy One with mortal Men to dwell:<br/>
By his prescript a Sanctuary is fram’d<br/>
Of Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein<br/>
An Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony,<br/>
The Records of his Cov’nant, over these<br/>
A Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings<br/>
Of two bright Cherubim, before him burn<br/>
Seaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing<br/>
The Heav’nly fires; over the Tent a Cloud<br/>
Shall rest by Day, a fierie gleame by Night,<br/>
Save when they journie, and at length they come,<br/>
Conducted by his Angel to the Land<br/>
Promisd to <i>Abraham</i> and his Seed: the rest<br/>
Were long to tell, how many Battels fought,<br/>
How many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won,<br/>
Or how the Sun shall in mid Heav’n stand still<br/>
A day entire, and Nights due course adjourne,<br/>
Mans voice commanding, Sun in <i>Gibeon</i> stand,<br/>
And thou Moon in the vale of <i>Aialon</i>,<br/>
Till <i>Israel</i> overcome; so call the third<br/>
From <i>Abraham</i>, Son of <i>Isaac</i>, and from him<br/>
His whole descent, who thus shall <i>Canaan</i> win.<br/>

<p class="poem">
Here <i>Adam</i> interpos’d.  O sent from Heav’n,<br/>
Enlightner of my darkness, gracious things<br/>
Thou hast reveald, those chiefly which concerne<br/>
Just <i>Abraham</i> and his Seed: now first I finde<br/>
Mine eyes true op’ning, and my heart much eas’d,<br/>
Erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom<br/>
Of mee and all Mankind; but now I see<br/>
His day, in whom all Nations shall be blest,<br/>
Favour unmerited by me, who sought<br/>
Forbidd’n knowledge by forbidd’n means.<br/>
This yet I apprehend not, why to those<br/>
Among whom God will deigne to dwell on Earth<br/>
So many and so various Laws are giv’n;<br/>
So many Laws argue so many sins<br/>
Among them; how can God with such reside?<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
To whom thus <i>Michael</i>.  Doubt not but that sin<br/>
Will reign among them, as of thee begot;<br/>
And therefore was Law given them to evince<br/>
Thir natural pravitie, by stirring up<br/>
Sin against Law to fight; that when they see<br/>
Law can discover sin, but not remove,<br/>
Save by those shadowie expiations weak,<br/>
The bloud of Bulls and Goats, they may conclude<br/>
Some bloud more precious must be paid for Man,<br/>
Just for unjust, that in such righteousness<br/>
To them by Faith imputed, they may finde<br/>
Justification towards God, and peace<br/>
Of Conscience, which the Law by Ceremonies<br/>
Cannot appease, nor Man the moral part<br/>
Perform, and not performing cannot live.<br/>
So Law appears imperfet, and but giv’n<br/>
With purpose to resign them in full time<br/>
Up to a better Cov’nant, disciplin’d<br/>
From shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit,<br/>
From imposition of strict Laws, to free<br/>
Acceptance of large Grace, from servil fear<br/>
To filial, works of Law to works of Faith.<br/>
And therefore shall not <i>Moses</i>, though of God<br/>
Highly belov’d, being but the Minister<br/>
Of Law, his people into <i>Canaan</i> lead;<br/>
But <i>Joshua</i> whom the Gentiles <i>Jesus</i> call,<br/>
His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell<br/>
The adversarie Serpent, and bring back<br/>
Through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man<br/>
Safe to eternal Paradise of rest.<br/>
Meanwhile they in thir earthly <i>Canaan</i> plac’t<br/>
Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins<br/>
National interrupt thir public peace,<br/>
Provoking God to raise them enemies:<br/>
From whom as oft he saves them penitent<br/>
By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom<br/>
The second, both for pietie renownd<br/>
And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive<br/>
Irrevocable, that his Regal Throne<br/>
For ever shall endure; the like shall sing<br/>
All Prophecie, That of the Royal Stock<br/>
Of <i>David</i> (so I name this King) shall rise<br/>
A Son, the Womans Seed to thee foretold,<br/>
Foretold to <i>Abraham</i>, as in whom shall trust<br/>
All Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings<br/>
The last, for of his Reign shall be no end.<br/>
But first a long succession must ensue,<br/>
And his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom fam’d,<br/>
The clouded Ark of God till then in Tents<br/>
Wandring, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine.<br/>
Such follow him, as shall be registerd<br/>
Part good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle,<br/>
Whose foul Idolatries, and other faults<br/>
Heapt to the popular summe, will so incense<br/>
God, as to leave them, and expose thir Land,<br/>
Thir Citie, his Temple, and his holy Ark<br/>
With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey<br/>
To that proud Citie, whose high Walls thou saw’st<br/>
Left in confusion, <i>Babylon</i> thence call’d.<br/>
There in captivitie he lets them dwell<br/>
The space of seventie years, then brings them back,<br/>
Remembring mercie, and his Cov’nant sworn<br/>
To <i>David</i>, stablisht as the dayes of Heav’n.<br/>
Returnd from <i>Babylon</i> by leave of Kings<br/>
Thir Lords, whom God dispos’d, the house of God<br/>
They first re-edifie, and for a while<br/>
In mean estate live moderate, till grown<br/>
In wealth and multitude, factious they grow;<br/>
But first among the Priests dissension springs,<br/>
Men who attend the Altar, and should most<br/>
Endeavour Peace: thir strife pollution brings<br/>
Upon the Temple it self: at last they seise<br/>
The Scepter, and regard not <i>Davids</i> Sons,<br/>
Then loose it to a stranger, that the true<br/>
Anointed King <i>Messiah</i> might be born<br/>
Barr’d of his right; yet at his Birth a Starr<br/>
Unseen before in Heav’n proclaims him com,<br/>
And guides the Eastern Sages, who enquire<br/>
His place, to offer Incense, Myrrh, and Gold;<br/>
His place of birth a solemn Angel tells<br/>
To simple Shepherds, keeping watch by night;<br/>
They gladly thither haste, and by a Quire<br/>
Of squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung.<br/>
A Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire<br/>
The Power of the most High; he shall ascend<br/>
The Throne hereditarie, and bound his Reign<br/>
With earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heav’ns.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
He ceas’d, discerning <i>Adam</i> with such joy<br/>
Surcharg’d, as had like grief bin dew’d in tears,<br/>
Without the vent of words, which these he breathd.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O Prophet of glad tidings, finisher<br/>
Of utmost hope! now clear I understand<br/>
What oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain,<br/>
Why our great expectation should be call’d<br/>
The seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile,<br/>
High in the love of Heav’n, yet from my Loynes<br/>
Thou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the Son<br/>
Of God most High; So God with man unites.<br/>
Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise<br/>
Expect with mortal paine: say where and when<br/>
Thir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
To whom thus <i>Michael</i>.  Dream not of thir fight,<br/>
As of a Duel, or the local wounds<br/>
Of head or heel: not therefore joynes the Son<br/>
Manhood to God-head, with more strength to foil<br/>
Thy enemie; nor so is overcome<br/>
<i>Satan</i>, whose fall from Heav’n, a deadlier bruise,<br/>
Disabl’d not to give thee thy deaths wound:<br/>
Which hee, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure,<br/>
Not by destroying <i>Satan</i>, but his works<br/>
In thee and in thy Seed: nor can this be,<br/>
But by fulfilling that which thou didst want,<br/>
Obedience to the Law of God, impos’d<br/>
On penaltie of death, and suffering death,<br/>
The penaltie to thy transgression due,<br/>
And due to theirs which out of thine will grow:<br/>
So onely can high Justice rest appaid.<br/>
The Law of God exact he shall fulfill<br/>
Both by obedience and by love, though love<br/>
Alone fulfill the Law; thy punishment<br/>
He shall endure by coming in the Flesh<br/>
To a reproachful life and cursed death,<br/>
Proclaiming Life to all who shall believe<br/>
In his redemption, and that his obedience<br/>
Imputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits<br/>
To save them, not thir own, though legal works.<br/>
For this he shall live hated, be blasphem’d,<br/>
Seis’d on by force, judg’d, and to death condemnd<br/>
A shameful and accurst, naild to the Cross<br/>
By his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life;<br/>
But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies,<br/>
The Law that is against thee, and the sins<br/>
Of all mankinde, with him there crucifi’d,<br/>
Never to hurt them more who rightly trust<br/>
In this his satisfaction; so he dies,<br/>
But soon revives, Death over him no power<br/>
Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light<br/>
Returne, the Starres of Morn shall see him rise<br/>
Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,<br/>
Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems,<br/>
His death for Man, as many as offerd Life<br/>
Neglect not, and the benefit imbrace<br/>
By Faith not void of works: this God-like act<br/>
Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have dy’d,<br/>
In sin for ever lost from life; this act<br/>
Shall bruise the head of <i>Satan</i>, crush his strength<br/>
Defeating Sin and Death, his two maine armes,<br/>
And fix farr deeper in his head thir stings<br/>
Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel,<br/>
Or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep,<br/>
A gentle wafting to immortal Life.<br/>
Nor after resurrection shall he stay<br/>
Longer on Earth then certaine times to appeer<br/>
To his Disciples, Men who in his Life<br/>
Still follow’d him; to them shall leave in charge<br/>
To teach all nations what of him they learn’d<br/>
And his Salvation, them who shall beleeve<br/>
Baptizing in the profluent streame, the signe<br/>
Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life<br/>
Pure, and in mind prepar’d, if so befall,<br/>
For death, like that which the redeemer dy’d.<br/>
All Nations they shall teach; for from that day<br/>
Not onely to the Sons of <i>Abrahams</i> Loines<br/>
Salvation shall be Preacht, but to the Sons<br/>
Of <i>Abrahams</i> Faith wherever through the world;<br/>
So in his seed all Nations shall be blest.<br/>
Then to the Heav’n of Heav’ns he shall ascend<br/>
With victory, triumphing through the aire<br/>
Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise<br/>
The Serpent, Prince of aire, and drag in Chaines<br/>
Through all his realme, &amp; there confounded leave;<br/>
Then enter into glory, and resume<br/>
His Seat at Gods right hand, exalted high<br/>
Above all names in Heav’n; and thence shall come,<br/>
When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe,<br/>
With glory and power to judge both quick &amp; dead,<br/>
To judge th’ unfaithful dead, but to reward<br/>
His faithful, and receave them into bliss,<br/>
Whether in Heav’n or Earth, for then the Earth<br/>
Shall all be Paradise, far happier place<br/>
Then this of <i>Eden</i>, and far happier daies.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake th’ Archangel <i>Michael</i>, then paus’d,<br/>
As at the Worlds great period; and our Sire<br/>
Replete with joy and wonder thus repli’d.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O goodness infinite, goodness immense!<br/>
That all this good of evil shall produce,<br/>
And evil turn to good; more wonderful<br/>
Then that which by creation first brought forth<br/>
Light out of darkness! full of doubt I stand,<br/>
Whether I should repent me now of sin<br/>
By mee done and occasiond, or rejoyce<br/>
Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring,<br/>
To God more glory, more good will to Men<br/>
From God, and over wrauth grace shall abound.<br/>
But say, if our deliverer up to Heav’n<br/>
Must reascend, what will betide the few<br/>
His faithful, left among th’ unfaithful herd,<br/>
The enemies of truth; who then shall guide<br/>
His people, who defend? will they not deale<br/>
Wors with his followers then with him they dealt?<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Be sure they will, said th’ Angel; but from Heav’n<br/>
Hee to his own a Comforter will send,<br/>
The promise of the Father, who shall dwell<br/>
His Spirit within them, and the Law of Faith<br/>
Working through love, upon thir hearts shall write,<br/>
To guide them in all truth, and also arme<br/>
With spiritual Armour, able to resist<br/>
<i>Satans</i> assaults, and quench his fierie darts<br/>
What Man can do against them, not affraid,<br/>
Though to the death, against such cruelties<br/>
With inward consolations recompenc’t,<br/>
And oft supported so as shall amaze<br/>
Thir proudest persecuters: for the Spirit<br/>
Powrd first on his Apostles, whom he sends<br/>
To evangelize the Nations, then on all<br/>
Baptiz’d, shall them with wondrous gifts endue<br/>
To speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles,<br/>
As did thir Lord before them.  Thus they win<br/>
Great numbers of each Nation to receave<br/>
With joy the tidings brought from Heav’n: at length<br/>
Thir Ministry perform’d, and race well run,<br/>
Thir doctrine and thir story written left,<br/>
They die; but in thir room, as they forewarne,<br/>
Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves,<br/>
Who all the sacred mysteries of Heav’n<br/>
To thir own vile advantages shall turne<br/>
Of lucre and ambition, and the truth<br/>
With superstitions and traditions taint,<br/>
Left onely in those written Records pure,<br/>
Though not but by the Spirit understood.<br/>
Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names,<br/>
Places and titles, and with these to joine<br/>
Secular power, though feigning still to act<br/>
By spiritual, to themselves appropriating<br/>
The Spirit of God, promisd alike and giv’n<br/>
To all Beleevers; and from that pretense,<br/>
Spiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force<br/>
On every conscience; Laws which none shall finde<br/>
Left them inrould, or what the Spirit within<br/>
Shall on the heart engrave.  What will they then<br/>
But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and binde<br/>
His consort Libertie; what, but unbuild<br/>
His living Temples, built by Faith to stand,<br/>
Thir own Faith not anothers: for on Earth<br/>
Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard<br/>
Infallible? yet many will presume:<br/>
Whence heavie persecution shall arise<br/>
On all who in the worship persevere<br/>
Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, farr greater part,<br/>
Will deem in outward Rites and specious formes<br/>
Religion satisfi’d; Truth shall retire<br/>
Bestuck with slandrous darts, and works of Faith<br/>
Rarely be found: so shall the World goe on,<br/>
To good malignant, to bad men benigne,<br/>
Under her own waight groaning, till the day<br/>
Appeer of respiration to the just,<br/>
And vengeance to the wicked, at return<br/>
Of him so lately promis’d to thy aid,<br/>
The Womans seed, obscurely then foretold,<br/>
Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord,<br/>
Last in the Clouds from Heav’n to be reveald<br/>
In glory of the Father, to dissolve<br/>
<i>Satan</i> with his perverted World, then raise<br/>
From the conflagrant mass, purg’d and refin’d,<br/>
New Heav’ns, new Earth, Ages of endless date<br/>
Founded in righteousness and peace and love,<br/>
To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
He ended; and thus <i>Adam</i> last reply’d.<br/>
How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest,<br/>
Measur’d this transient World, the Race of time,<br/>
Till time stand fixt: beyond is all abyss,<br/>
Eternitie, whose end no eye can reach.<br/>
Greatly instructed I shall hence depart,<br/>
Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill<br/>
Of knowledge, what this vessel can containe;<br/>
Beyond which was my folly to aspire.<br/>
Henceforth I learne, that to obey is best,<br/>
And love with feare the onely God, to walk<br/>
As in his presence, ever to observe<br/>
His providence, and on him sole depend,<br/>
Merciful over all his works, with good<br/>
Still overcoming evil, and by small<br/>
Accomplishing great things, by things deemd weak<br/>
Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise<br/>
By simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake<br/>
Is fortitude to highest victorie,<br/>
And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life;<br/>
Taught this by his example whom I now<br/>
Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
To whom thus also th’ Angel last repli’d:<br/>
This having learnt, thou hast attaind the summe<br/>
Of wisdom; hope no higher, though all the Starrs<br/>
Thou knewst by name, and all th’ ethereal Powers,<br/>
All secrets of the deep, all Natures works,<br/>
Or works of God in Heav’n, Air, Earth, or Sea,<br/>
And all the riches of this World enjoydst,<br/>
And all the rule, one Empire; onely add<br/>
Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith,<br/>
Add Vertue, Patience, Temperance, add Love,<br/>
By name to come call’d Charitie, the soul<br/>
Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath<br/>
To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess<br/>
A Paradise within thee, happier farr.<br/>
Let us descend now therefore from this top<br/>
Of Speculation; for the hour precise<br/>
Exacts our parting hence; and see the Guards,<br/>
By mee encampt on yonder Hill, expect<br/>
Thir motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword,<br/>
In signal of remove, waves fiercely round;<br/>
We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve;<br/>
Her also I with gentle Dreams have calm’d<br/>
Portending good, and all her spirits compos’d<br/>
To meek submission: thou at season fit<br/>
Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard,<br/>
Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know,<br/>
The great deliverance by her Seed to come<br/>
(For by the Womans Seed) on all Mankind.<br/>
That ye may live, which will be many dayes,<br/>
Both in one Faith unanimous though sad,<br/>
With cause for evils past, yet much more cheer’d<br/>
With meditation on the happie end.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
He ended, and they both descend the Hill;<br/>
Descended, <i>Adam</i> to the Bowre where <i>Eve</i><br/>
Lay sleeping ran before, but found her wak’t;<br/>
And thus with words not sad she him receav’d.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Whence thou returnst, &amp; whither wentst, I know;<br/>
For God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise,<br/>
Which he hath sent propitious, some great good<br/>
Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress<br/>
VVearied I fell asleep: but now lead on;<br/>
In mee is no delay; with thee to goe,<br/>
Is to stay here; without thee here to stay,<br/>
Is to go hence unwilling; thou to mee<br/>
Art all things under Heav’n, all places thou,<br/>
VVho for my wilful crime art banisht hence.<br/>
This further consolation yet secure<br/>
I carry hence; though all by mee is lost,<br/>
Such favour I unworthie am voutsaft,<br/>
By mee the Promis’d Seed shall all restore.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake our Mother <i>Eve</i>, and <i>Adam</i> heard<br/>
VVell pleas’d, but answer’d not; for now too nigh<br/>
Th’ Archangel stood, and from the other Hill<br/>
To thir fixt Station, all in bright array<br/>
The Cherubim descended; on the ground<br/>
Gliding meteorous, as Ev’ning Mist<br/>
Ris’n from a River o’re the marish glides,<br/>
And gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel<br/>
Homeward returning.  High in Front advanc’t,<br/>
The brandisht Sword of God before them blaz’d<br/>
Fierce as a Comet; which with torrid heat,<br/>
And vapour as the <i>Libyan</i> Air adust,<br/>
Began to parch that temperate Clime; whereat<br/>
In either hand the hastning Angel caught<br/>
Our lingring Parents, and to th’ Eastern Gate<br/>
Let them direct, and down the Cliff as fast<br/>
To the subjected Plaine; then disappeer’d.<br/>
They looking back, all th’ Eastern side beheld<br/>
Of Paradise, so late thir happie seat,<br/>
Wav’d over by that flaming Brand, the Gate<br/>
With dreadful Faces throng’d and fierie Armes:<br/>
Som natural tears they drop’d, but wip’d them soon;<br/>
The World was all before them, where to choose<br/>
Thir place of rest, and Providence thir guide:<br/>
They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow,<br/>
Through <i>Eden</i> took thir solitarie way.<br/>
