Of Man’s First Disobedience, and the Fruit<br/>
Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast<br/>
Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,<br/>
With loss of <i>Eden</i>, till one greater Man<br/>
Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,<br/>
Sing Heav’nly Muse, that on the secret top<br/>
Of <i>Oreb</i>, or of <i>Sinai</i>, didst inspire<br/>
That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,<br/>
In the Beginning how the Heav’ns and Earth<br/>
Rose out of <i>Chaos</i>: Or if <i>Sion</i> Hill<br/>
Delight thee more, and <i>Siloa’s</i> Brook that flow’d<br/>
Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence<br/>
Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,<br/>
That with no middle flight intends to soar<br/>
Above th’ <i>Aonian</i> Mount, while it pursues<br/>
Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.<br/>
And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer<br/>
Before all Temples th’ upright heart and pure,<br/>
Instruct me, for Thou know’st; Thou from the first<br/>
Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread<br/>
Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss<br/>
And mad’st it pregnant: What in me is dark<br/>
Illumine, what is low raise and support;<br/>
That to the highth of this great Argument<br/>
I may assert th’ Eternal Providence,<br/>
And justifie the wayes of God to men.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Say first, for Heav’n hides nothing from thy view<br/>
Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause<br/>
Mov’d our Grand Parents in that happy State,<br/>
Favour’d of Heav’n so highly, to fall off<br/>
From their Creator, and transgress his Will<br/>
For one restraint, Lords of the World besides?<br/>
Who first seduc’d them to that fowl revolt?<br/>
Th’ infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile<br/>
Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv’d<br/>
The Mother of Mankinde, what time his Pride<br/>
Had cast him out from Heav’n, with all his Host<br/>
Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring<br/>
To set himself in Glory above his Peers,<br/>
He trusted to have equal’d the most High,<br/>
If he oppos’d; and with ambitious aim<br/>
Against the Throne and Monarchy of God<br/>
Rais’d impious War in Heav’n and Battel proud<br/>
With vain attempt.  Him the Almighty Power<br/>
Hurld headlong flaming from th’ Ethereal Skie<br/>
With hideous ruine and combustion down<br/>
To bottomless perdition, there to dwell<br/>
In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire,<br/>
Who durst defie th’ Omnipotent to Arms.<br/>
Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night<br/>
To mortal men, he with his horrid crew<br/>
Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe<br/>
Confounded though immortal: But his doom<br/>
Reserv’d him to more wrath; for now the thought<br/>
Both of lost happiness and lasting pain<br/>
Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes<br/>
That witness’d huge affliction and dismay<br/>
Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate:<br/>
At once as far as Angels kenn he views<br/>
The dismal Situation waste and wilde,<br/>
A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round<br/>
As one great Furnace flam’d, yet from those flames<br/>
No light, but rather darkness visible<br/>
Serv’d only to discover sights of woe,<br/>
Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace<br/>
And rest can never dwell, hope never comes<br/>
That comes to all; but torture without end<br/>
Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed<br/>
With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum’d:<br/>
Such place Eternal Justice had prepar’d<br/>
For those rebellious, here their Prison ordain’d<br/>
In utter darkness, and their portion set<br/>
As far remov’d from God and light of Heav’n<br/>
As from the Center thrice to th’ utmost Pole.<br/>
O how unlike the place from whence they fell!<br/>
There the companions of his fall, o’rewhelm’d<br/>
With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,<br/>
He soon discerns, and weltring by his side<br/>
One next himself in power, and next in crime,<br/>
Long after known in <i>Palestine</i>, and nam’d<br/>
<i>Beelzebub</i>.  To whom th’ Arch-Enemy,<br/>
And thence in Heav’n call’d Satan, with bold words<br/>
Breaking the horrid silence thus began.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
If thou beest he; But O how fall’n! how chang’d<br/>
From him, who in the happy Realms of Light<br/>
Cloth’d with transcendent brightnes didst outshine<br/>
Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league,<br/>
United thoughts and counsels, equal hope,<br/>
And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize,<br/>
Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd<br/>
In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest<br/>
From what highth fal’n, so much the stronger provd<br/>
He with his Thunder: and till then who knew<br/>
The force of those dire Arms? yet not for those<br/>
Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage<br/>
Can else inflict do I repent or change,<br/>
Though chang’d in outward lustre; that fixt mind<br/>
And high disdain, from sence of injur’d merit,<br/>
That with the mightiest rais’d me to contend,<br/>
And to the fierce contention brought along<br/>
Innumerable force of Spirits arm’d<br/>
That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring,<br/>
His utmost power with adverse power oppos’d<br/>
In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav’n,<br/>
And shook his throne.  What though the field be lost?<br/>
All is not lost; the unconquerable Will,<br/>
And study of revenge, immortal hate,<br/>
And courage never to submit or yield:<br/>
And what is else not to be overcome?<br/>
That Glory never shall his wrath or might<br/>
Extort from me.  To bow and sue for grace<br/>
With suppliant knee, and deifie his power<br/>
Who from the terrour of this Arm so late<br/>
Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed,<br/>
That were an ignominy and shame beneath<br/>
This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods<br/>
And this Empyreal substance cannot fail,<br/>
Since through experience of this great event<br/>
In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc’t,<br/>
We may with more successful hope resolve<br/>
To wage by force or guile eternal Warr<br/>
Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe,<br/>
Who now triumphs, and in th’ excess of joy<br/>
Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav’n.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So spake th’ Apostate Angel, though in pain,<br/>
Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare:<br/>
And him thus answer’d soon his bold Compeer.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers,<br/>
That led th’ imbattelld Seraphim to Warr<br/>
Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds<br/>
Fearless, endanger’d Heav’ns perpetual King;<br/>
And put to proof his high Supremacy,<br/>
Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate,<br/>
Too well I see and rue the dire event,<br/>
That with sad overthrow and foul defeat<br/>
Hath lost us Heav’n, and all this mighty Host<br/>
In horrible destruction laid thus low,<br/>
As far as Gods and Heav’nly Essences<br/>
Can Perish: for the mind and spirit remains<br/>
Invincible, and vigour soon returns,<br/>
Though all our Glory extinct, and happy state<br/>
Here swallow’d up in endless misery.<br/>
But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now<br/>
Of force believe Almighty, since no less<br/>
Then such could hav orepow’rd such force as ours)<br/>
Have left us this our spirit and strength intire<br/>
Strongly to suffer and support our pains,<br/>
That we may so suffice his vengeful ire,<br/>
Or do him mightier service as his thralls<br/>
By right of Warr, what e’re his business be<br/>
Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire,<br/>
Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep;<br/>
What can it then avail though yet we feel<br/>
Strength undiminisht, or eternal being<br/>
To undergo eternal punishment?<br/>
Whereto with speedy words th’ Arch-fiend reply’d.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Fall’n Cherube, to be weak is miserable<br/>
Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure,<br/>
To do ought good never will be our task,<br/>
But ever to do ill our sole delight,<br/>
As being the contrary to his high will<br/>
Whom we resist.  If then his Providence<br/>
Out of our evil seek to bring forth good,<br/>
Our labour must be to pervert that end,<br/>
And out of good still to find means of evil;<br/>
Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps<br/>
Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb<br/>
His inmost counsels from their destind aim.<br/>
But see the angry Victor hath recall’d<br/>
His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit<br/>
Back to the Gates of Heav’n: The Sulphurous Hail<br/>
Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid<br/>
The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice<br/>
Of Heav’n receiv’d us falling, and the Thunder,<br/>
Wing’d with red Lightning and impetuous rage,<br/>
Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now<br/>
To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep.<br/>
Let us not slip th’ occasion, whether scorn,<br/>
Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe.<br/>
Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde,<br/>
The seat of desolation, voyd of light,<br/>
Save what the glimmering of these livid flames<br/>
Casts pale and dreadful?  Thither let us tend<br/>
From off the tossing of these fiery waves,<br/>
There rest, if any rest can harbour there,<br/>
And reassembling our afflicted Powers,<br/>
Consult how we may henceforth most offend<br/>
Our Enemy, our own loss how repair,<br/>
How overcome this dire Calamity,<br/>
What reinforcement we may gain from Hope,<br/>
If not what resolution from despare.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Thus Satan talking to his neerest Mate<br/>
With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes<br/>
That sparkling blaz’d, his other Parts besides<br/>
Prone on the Flood, extended long and large<br/>
Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge<br/>
As whom the Fables name of monstrous size,<br/>
<i>Titanian</i>, or <i>Earth-born</i>, that warr’d on <i>Jove</i>,<br/>
<i>Briarios</i> or <i>Typhon</i>, whom the Den<br/>
By ancient <i>Tarsus</i> held, or that Sea-beast<br/>
<i>Leviathan</i>, which God of all his works<br/>
Created hugest that swim th’ Ocean stream:<br/>
Him haply slumbring on the <i>Norway</i> foam<br/>
The Pilot of some small night-founder’d Skiff,<br/>
Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell,<br/>
With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind<br/>
Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night<br/>
Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes:<br/>
So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay<br/>
Chain’d on the burning Lake, nor ever thence<br/>
Had ris’n or heav’d his head, but that the will<br/>
And high permission of all-ruling Heaven<br/>
Left him at large to his own dark designs,<br/>
That with reiterated crimes he might<br/>
Heap on himself damnation, while he sought<br/>
Evil to others, and enrag’d might see<br/>
How all his malice serv’d but to bring forth<br/>
Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn<br/>
On Man by him seduc’t, but on himself<br/>
Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour’d.<br/>
Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool<br/>
His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames<br/>
Drivn backward slope their pointing spires, &amp; rowld<br/>
In billows, leave i’th’ midst a horrid Vale.<br/>
Then with expanded wings he stears his flight<br/>
Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air<br/>
That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land<br/>
He lights, if it were Land that ever burn’d<br/>
With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire;<br/>
And such appear’d in hue, as when the force<br/>
Of subterranean wind transports a Hill<br/>
Torn from <i>Pelorus</i>, or the shatter’d side<br/>
Of thundring <i>Aetna</i>, whose combustible<br/>
And fewel’d entrals thence conceiving Fire,<br/>
Sublim’d with Mineral fury, aid the Winds,<br/>
And leave a singed bottom all involv’d<br/>
With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole<br/>
Of unblest feet.  Him followed his next Mate,<br/>
Both glorying to have scap’t the <i>Stygian</i> flood<br/>
As Gods, and by their own recover’d strength,<br/>
Not by the sufferance of supernal Power.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime,<br/>
Said then the lost Arch Angel, this the seat<br/>
That we must change for Heav’n, this mournful gloom<br/>
For that celestial light?  Be it so, since hee<br/>
Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid<br/>
What shall be right: fardest from him is best<br/>
Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream<br/>
Above his equals.  Farewel happy Fields<br/>
Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail<br/>
Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell<br/>
Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings<br/>
A mind not to be chang’d by Place or Time.<br/>
The mind is its own place, and in it self<br/>
Can make a Heav’n of Hell, a Hell of Heav’n.<br/>
What matter where, if I be still the same,<br/>
And what I should be, all but less then hee<br/>
Whom Thunder hath made greater?  Here at least<br/>
We shall be free; th’ Almighty hath not built<br/>
Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:<br/>
Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce<br/>
To reign is worth ambition though in Hell:<br/>
Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav’n.<br/>
But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,<br/>
Th’ associates and copartners of our loss<br/>
Lye thus astonisht on th’ oblivious Pool,<br/>
And call them not to share with us their part<br/>
In this unhappy Mansion, or once more<br/>
With rallied Arms to try what may be yet<br/>
Regaind in Heav’n, or what more lost in Hell?<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
So <i>Satan</i> spake, and him <i>Beelzebub</i><br/>
Thus answer’d.  Leader of those Armies bright,<br/>
Which but th’ Omnipotent none could have foyld,<br/>
If once they hear that voyce, their liveliest pledge<br/>
Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft<br/>
In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge<br/>
Of battel when it rag’d, in all assaults<br/>
Their surest signal, they will soon resume<br/>
New courage and revive, though now they lye<br/>
Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire,<br/>
As we erewhile, astounded and amaz’d,<br/>
No wonder, fall’n such a pernicious highth.<br/>

<p class="poem">
He scarce had ceas’t when the superiour Fiend<br/>
Was moving toward the shore; his ponderous shield<br/>
Ethereal temper, massy, large and round,<br/>
Behind him cast; the broad circumference<br/>
Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb<br/>
Through Optic Glass the <i>Tuscan</i> Artist views<br/>
At Ev’ning from the top of <i>Fesole</i>,<br/>
Or in <i>Valdarno</i>, to descry new Lands,<br/>
Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe.<br/>
His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine<br/>
Hewn on <i>Norwegian</i> hills, to be the Mast<br/>
Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand,<br/>
He walkt with to support uneasie steps<br/>
Over the burning Marle, not like those steps<br/>
On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime<br/>
Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire;<br/>
Nathless he so endur’d, till on the Beach<br/>
Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call’d<br/>
His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans’t<br/>
Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks<br/>
In <i>Vallombrosa</i>, where th’ <i>Etrurian</i> shades<br/>
High overarch’t imbowr; or scatterd sedge<br/>
Afloat, when with fierce Winds <i>Orion</i> arm’d<br/>
Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew<br/>
<i>Busiris</i> and his <i>Memphian</i> Chivalrie,<br/>
VVhile with perfidious hatred they pursu’d<br/>
The Sojourners of <i>Goshen</i>, who beheld<br/>
From the safe shore their floating Carkases<br/>
And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown<br/>
Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood,<br/>
Under amazement of their hideous change.<br/>
He call’d so loud, that all the hollow Deep<br/>
Of Hell resounded.  Princes, Potentates,<br/>
Warriers, the Flowr of Heav’n, once yours, now lost,<br/>
If such astonishment as this can sieze<br/>
Eternal spirits; or have ye chos’n this place<br/>
After the toyl of Battel to repose<br/>
Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find<br/>
To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav’n?<br/>
Or in this abject posture have ye sworn<br/>
To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds<br/>
Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood<br/>
With scatter’d Arms and Ensigns, till anon<br/>
His swift pursuers from Heav’n Gates discern<br/>
Th’ advantage, and descending tread us down<br/>
Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts<br/>
Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe.<br/>
Awake, arise, or be for ever fall’n.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung<br/>
Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch<br/>
On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread,<br/>
Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake.<br/>
Nor did they not perceave the evil plight<br/>
In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel;<br/>
Yet to their Generals Voyce they soon obeyd<br/>
Innumerable.  As when the potent Rod<br/>
Of <i>Amrams</i> Son in <i>Egypts</i> evill day<br/>
Wav’d round the Coast, up call’d a pitchy cloud<br/>
Of <i>Locusts</i>, warping on the Eastern Wind,<br/>
That ore the Realm of impious <i>Pharoah</i> hung<br/>
Like Night, and darken’d all the Land of <i>Nile</i>:<br/>
So numberless were those bad Angels seen<br/>
Hovering on wing under the Cope of Hell<br/>
’Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires;<br/>
Till, as a signal giv’n, th’ uplifted Spear<br/>
Of their great Sultan waving to direct<br/>
Thir course, in even ballance down they light<br/>
On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain;<br/>
A multitude, like which the populous North<br/>
Pour’d never from her frozen loyns, to pass<br/>
<i>Rhene</i> or the <i>Danaw</i>, when her barbarous Sons<br/>
Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread<br/>
Beneath <i>Gibraltar</i> to the <i>Lybian</i> sands.<br/>
Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band<br/>
The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood<br/>
Their great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms<br/>
Excelling human, Princely Dignities,<br/>
And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones;<br/>
Though of their Names in heav’nly Records now<br/>
Be no memorial, blotted out and ras’d<br/>
By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life.<br/>
Nor had they yet among the Sons of <i>Eve</i><br/>
Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth,<br/>
Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man,<br/>
By falsities and lyes the greatest part<br/>
Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake<br/>
God their Creator, and th’ invisible<br/>
Glory of him, that made them, to transform<br/>
Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn’d<br/>
With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold,<br/>
And Devils to adore for Deities:<br/>
Then were they known to men by various Names,<br/>
And various Idols through the Heathen World.<br/>
Say, Muse, their Names then known, who first, who last,<br/>
Rous’d from the slumber, on that fiery Couch,<br/>
At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth<br/>
Came singly where he stood on the bare strand,<br/>
While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof?<br/>
The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell<br/>
Roaming to seek their prey on earth, durst fix<br/>
Their Seats long after next the Seat of God,<br/>
Their Altars by his Altar, Gods ador’d<br/>
Among the Nations round, and durst abide<br/>
<i>Jehovah</i> thundring out of <i>Sion</i>, thron’d<br/>
Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac’d<br/>
Within his Sanctuary it self their Shrines,<br/>
Abominations; and with cursed things<br/>
His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan’d,<br/>
And with their darkness durst affront his light.<br/>
First <i>Moloch</i>, horrid King besmear’d with blood<br/>
Of human sacrifice, and parents tears,<br/>
Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud<br/>
Their childrens cries unheard, that past through fire<br/>
To his grim Idol.  Him the <i>Ammonite</i><br/>
Worshipt in <i>Rabba</i> and her watry Plain,<br/>
In <i>Argob</i> and in <i>Basan</i>, to the stream<br/>
Of utmost <i>Arnon</i>.  Nor content with such<br/>
Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart<br/>
Of <i>Solomon</i> he led by fraud to build<br/>
His Temple right against the Temple of God<br/>
On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove<br/>
The pleasant Vally of <i>Hinnom</i>, <i>Tophet</i> thence<br/>
And black <i>Gehenna</i> call’d, the Type of Hell.<br/>
Next <i>Chemos</i>, th’ obscene dread of <i>Moabs</i> Sons,<br/>
From <i>Aroer</i> to <i>Nebo</i>, and the wild<br/>
Of Southmost <i>Abarim</i>; in <i>Hesebon</i><br/>
And <i>Heronaim</i>, <i>Seons</i> Realm, beyond<br/>
The flowry Dale of <i>Sibma</i> clad with Vines,<br/>
And <i>Eleale</i> to th’ <i>Asphaltick</i> Pool.<br/>
<i>Peor</i> his other Name, when he entic’d<br/>
<i>Israel</i> in <i>Sittim</i> on their march from <i>Nile</i><br/>
To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe.<br/>
Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg’d<br/>
Even to that Hill of scandal, by the Grove<br/>
Of <i>Moloch</i> homicide, lust hard by hate;<br/>
Till good <i>Josiah</i> drove them thence to Hell.<br/>
With these came they, who from the bordring flood<br/>
Of old <i>Euphrates</i> to the Brook that parts<br/>
<i>Egypt</i> from <i>Syrian</i> ground, had general Names<br/>
Of <i>Baalim</i> and <i>Ashtaroth</i>, those male,<br/>
These Feminine.  For Spirits when they please<br/>
Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft<br/>
And uncompounded is their Essence pure,<br/>
Not ti’d or manacl’d with joynt or limb,<br/>
Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones,<br/>
Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose<br/>
Dilated or condens’t, bright or obscure,<br/>
Can execute their aerie purposes,<br/>
And works of love or enmity fulfill.<br/>
For those the Race of <i>Israel</i> oft forsook<br/>
Their living strength, and unfrequented left<br/>
His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down<br/>
To bestial Gods; for which their heads as low<br/>
Bow’d down in Battel, sunk before the Spear<br/>
Of despicable foes.  With these in troop<br/>
Came <i>Astoreth</i>, whom the <i>Phoenicians</i> call’d<br/>
<i>Astarte</i>, Queen of Heav’n, with crescent Horns;<br/>
To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon<br/>
<i>Sidonian</i> Virgins paid their Vows and Songs,<br/>
In <i>Sion</i> also not unsung, where stood<br/>
Her Temple on th’ offensive Mountain, built<br/>
By that uxorious King, whose heart though large,<br/>
Beguil’d by fair Idolatresses, fell<br/>
To Idols foul. <i>Thammuz</i> came next behind,<br/>
Whose annual wound in <i>Lebanon</i> allur’d<br/>
The <i>Syrian</i> Damsels to lament his fate<br/>
In amorous dittyes all a Summers day,<br/>
While smooth <i>Adonis</i> from his native Rock<br/>
Ran purple to the Sea, suppos’d with blood<br/>
Of <i>Thammuz</i> yearly wounded: the Love-tale<br/>
Infected <i>Sions</i> daughters with like heat,<br/>
Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch<br/>
<i>Ezekiel</i> saw, when by the Vision led<br/>
His eye survay’d the dark Idolatries<br/>
Of alienated <i>Judah</i>.  Next came one<br/>
Who mourn’d in earnest, when the Captive Ark<br/>
Maim’d his brute Image, head and hands lopt off<br/>
In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge,<br/>
Where he fell flat, and sham’d his Worshipers:<br/>
<i>Dagon</i> his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man<br/>
And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high<br/>
Rear’d in <i>Azotus</i>, dreaded through the Coast<br/>
Of <i>Palestine</i>, in <i>Gath</i> and <i>Ascalon</i>,<br/>
And <i>Accaron</i> and <i>Gaza’s</i> frontier bounds.<br/>
Him follow’d <i>Rimmon</i>, whose delightful Seat<br/>
Was fair <i>Damscus</i>, on the fertil Banks<br/>
Of <i>Abbana</i> and <i>Pharphar</i>, lucid streams.<br/>
He also against the house of God was bold:<br/>
A Leper once he lost and gain’d a King,<br/>
<i>Ahaz</i> his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew<br/>
Gods Altar to disparage and displace<br/>
For one of <i>Syrian</i> mode, whereon to burn<br/>
His odious offrings, and adore the Gods<br/>
Whom he had vanquisht. After these appear’d<br/>
A crew who under Names of old Renown,<br/>
<i>Osiris</i>, <i>Isis</i>, <i>Orus</i> and their Train<br/>
With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus’d<br/>
Fanatic <i>Egypt</i> and her Priests, to seek<br/>
Thir wandring Gods disguis’d in brutish forms<br/>
Rather then human.  Nor did <i>Israel</i> scape<br/>
Th’ infection when their borrow’d Gold compos’d<br/>
The Calf in <i>Oreb</i>: and the Rebel King<br/>
Doubl’d that sin in <i>Bethel</i> and in <i>Dan</i>,<br/>
Lik’ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox,<br/>
<i>Jehovah</i>, who in one Night when he pass’d<br/>
From <i>Egypt</i> marching, equal’d with one stroke<br/>
Both her first born and all her bleating Gods.<br/>
<i>Belial</i> came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd<br/>
Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love<br/>
Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood<br/>
Or Altar smoak’d; yet who more oft then hee<br/>
In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest<br/>
Turns Atheist, as did <i>Ely’s</i> Sons, who fill’d<br/>
With lust and violence the house of God.<br/>
In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns<br/>
And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse<br/>
Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs,<br/>
And injury and outrage: And when Night<br/>
Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons<br/>
Of <i>Belial</i>, flown with insolence and wine.<br/>
Witness the Streets of <i>Sodom</i>, and that night<br/>
In <i>Gibeah</i>, when hospitable Dores<br/>
Yielded thir Matrons to prevent worse rape.<br/>
These were the prime in order and in might;<br/>
The rest were long to tell, though far renown’d,<br/>
Th’ <i>Ionian</i> Gods, of <i>Javans</i> Issue held<br/>
Gods, yet confest later then Heav’n and Earth<br/>
Thir boasted Parents; <i>Titian</i> Heav’ns first born<br/>
With his enormous brood, and birthright seis’d<br/>
By younger <i>Saturn</i>, he from mightier <i>Jove</i><br/>
His own and <i>Rhea’s</i> Son like measure found;<br/>
So <i>Jove</i> usurping reign’d: these first in <i>Creet</i><br/>
And <i>Ida</i> known, thence on the Snowy top<br/>
Of cold <i>Olympus</i> rul’d the middle Air<br/>
Thir highest Heav’n; or on the <i>Delphian</i> Cliff,<br/>
Or in <i>Dodona</i>, and through all the bounds<br/>
Of <i>Doric</i> Land; or who with <i>Saturn</i> old<br/>
Fled over <i>Adria</i> to th’ <i>Hesperian</i> Fields,<br/>
And ore the <i>Celtic</i> roam’d the utmost Isles.<br/>
All these and more came flocking; but with looks<br/>
Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear’d<br/>
Obscure som glimps of joy, to have found thir chief<br/>
Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost<br/>
In loss it self; which on his count’nance cast<br/>
Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride<br/>
Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore<br/>
Semblance of worth not substance, gently rais’d<br/>
Their fainted courage, and dispel’d their fears.<br/>
Then strait commands that at the warlike sound<br/>
Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard<br/>
His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim’d<br/>
<i>Azazel</i> as his right, a Cherube tall:<br/>
Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld<br/>
Th’ Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc’t<br/>
Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind<br/>
With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz’d,<br/>
Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while<br/>
Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds:<br/>
At which the universal Host upsent<br/>
A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond<br/>
Frighted the Reign of <i>Chaos</i> and old Night.<br/>
All in a moment through the gloom were seen<br/>
Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air<br/>
With Orient Colours waving: with them rose<br/>
A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms<br/>
Appear’d, and serried Shields in thick array<br/>
Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move<br/>
In perfect <i>Phalanx</i> to the Dorian mood<br/>
Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais’d<br/>
To highth of noblest temper Hero’s old<br/>
Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage<br/>
Deliberate valour breath’d, firm and unmov’d<br/>
With dread of death to flight or foul retreat,<br/>
Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage<br/>
With solemn touches, troubl’d thoughts, and chase<br/>
Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain<br/>
From mortal or immortal minds.  Thus they<br/>
Breathing united force with fixed thought<br/>
Mov’d on in silence to soft Pipes that charm’d<br/>
Thir painful steps o’re the burnt soyle; and now<br/>
Advanc’t in view they stand, a horrid Front<br/>
Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise<br/>
Of Warriers old with order’d Spear and Shield,<br/>
Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief<br/>
Had to impose: He through the armed Files<br/>
Darts his experienc’t eye, and soon traverse<br/>
The whole Battalion views, thir order due,<br/>
Thir visages and stature as of Gods,<br/>
Thir number last he summs.  And now his heart<br/>
Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength<br/>
Glories: For never since created man,<br/>
Met such imbodied force, as nam’d with these<br/>
Could merit more then that small infantry<br/>
Warr’d on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood<br/>
Of <i>Phlegra</i> with th’ Heroic Race were joyn’d<br/>
That fought at <i>Theb’s</i> and <i>Ilium</i>, on each side<br/>
Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds<br/>
In Fable or <i>Romance</i> of <i>Uthers</i> Son<br/>
Begirt with <i>British</i> and <i>Armoric</i> Knights;<br/>
And all who since, Baptiz’d or Infidel<br/>
Jousted in <i>Aspramont</i> or <i>Montalban</i>,<br/>
<i>Damasco</i>, or <i>Marocco</i>, or <i>Trebisond</i>,<br/>
Or whom <i>Biserta</i> sent from <i>Afric</i> shore<br/>
When <i>Charlemain</i> with all his Peerage fell<br/>
By <i>Fontarabbia</i>.  Thus far these beyond<br/>
Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ’d<br/>
Thir dread Commander: he above the rest<br/>
In shape and gesture proudly eminent<br/>
Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost<br/>
All her Original brightness, nor appear’d<br/>
Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th’ excess<br/>
Of Glory obscur’d: As when the Sun new ris’n<br/>
Looks through the Horizontal misty Air<br/>
Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon<br/>
In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds<br/>
On half the Nations, and with fear of change<br/>
Perplexes Monarchs.  Dark’n’d so, yet shon<br/>
Above them all th’ Arch Angel: but his face<br/>
Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care<br/>
Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes<br/>
Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride<br/>
Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast<br/>
Signs of remorse and passion to behold<br/>
The fellows of his crime, the followers rather<br/>
(Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn’d<br/>
For ever now to have their lot in pain,<br/>
Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc’t<br/>
Of Heav’n, and from Eternal Splendors flung<br/>
For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood,<br/>
Thir Glory witherd.  As when Heavens Fire<br/>
Hath scath’d the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines,<br/>
With singed top their stately growth though bare<br/>
Stands on the blasted Heath.  He now prepar’d<br/>
To speak; whereat their doubl’d Ranks they bend<br/>
From Wing to Wing, and half enclose him round<br/>
With all his Peers: attention held them mute.<br/>
Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spite of scorn,<br/>
Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last<br/>
Words interwove with sighs found out their way.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers<br/>
Matchless, but with th’ Almighty, and that strife<br/>
Was not inglorious, though th’ event was dire,<br/>
As this place testifies, and this dire change<br/>
Hateful to utter: but what power of mind<br/>
Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth<br/>
Of knowledge past or present, could have fear’d,<br/>
How such united force of Gods, how such<br/>
As stood like these, could ever know repulse?<br/>
For who can yet beleeve, though after loss,<br/>
That all these puissant Legions, whose exile<br/>
Hath emptied Heav’n, shall faile to re-ascend<br/>
Self-rais’d, and repossess their native seat.<br/>
For me, be witness all the Host of Heav’n,<br/>
If counsels different, or danger shun’d<br/>
By me, have lost our hopes.  But he who reigns<br/>
Monarch in Heav’n, till then as one secure<br/>
Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute,<br/>
Consent or custome, and his Regal State<br/>
Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal’d,<br/>
Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall.<br/>
Henceforth his might we know, and know our own<br/>
So as not either to provoke, or dread<br/>
New warr, provok’t; our better part remains<br/>
To work in close design, by fraud or guile<br/>
What force effected not: that he no less<br/>
At length from us may find, who overcomes<br/>
By force, hath overcome but half his foe.<br/>
Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife<br/>
There went a fame in Heav’n that he ere long<br/>
Intended to create, and therein plant<br/>
A generation, whom his choice regard<br/>
Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven:<br/>
Thither, if but to prie, shall be perhaps<br/>
Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere:<br/>
For this Infernal Pit shall never hold<br/>
Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th’ Abysse<br/>
Long under darkness cover.  But these thoughts<br/>
Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird,<br/>
For who can think Submission?  Warr then, Warr<br/>
Open or understood must be resolv’d.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew<br/>
Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs<br/>
Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze<br/>
Far round illumin’d hell: highly they rag’d<br/>
Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped arm’s<br/>
Clash’d on their sounding shields the din of war,<br/>
Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heav’n.<br/>
</p>
<p class="poem">
There stood a Hill not far whose griesly top<br/>
Belch’d fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire<br/>
Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign<br/>
That in his womb was hid metallic Ore,<br/>
The work of Sulphur.  Thither wing’d with speed<br/>
A numerous Brigad hasten’d.  As when bands<br/>
Of Pioners with Spade and Pickaxe arm’d<br/>
Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field,<br/>
Or cast a Rampart.  <i>Mammon</i> led them on,<br/>
<i>Mammon</i>, the least erected Spirit that fell<br/>
From heav’n, for ev’n in heav’n his looks &amp; thoughts<br/>
Were always downward bent, admiring more<br/>
The riches of Heav’ns pavement, trod’n Gold,<br/>
Then aught divine or holy else enjoy’d<br/>
In vision beatific: by him first<br/>
Men also, and by his suggestion taught,<br/>
Ransack’d the Center, and with impious hands<br/>
Rifl’d the bowels of thir mother Earth<br/>
For Treasures better hid.  Soon had his crew<br/>
Op’nd into the Hill a spacious wound<br/>
And dig’d out ribs of Gold.  Let none admire<br/>
That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best<br/>
Deserve the pretious bane.  And here let those<br/>
Who boast in mortal things, and wondring tell<br/>
Of <i>Babel</i>, and the works of <i>Memphian</i> Kings,<br/>
Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame,<br/>
And Strength and Art are easily outdone<br/>
By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour<br/>
What in an age they with incessant toyle<br/>
And hands innumerable scarce perform<br/>
Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar’d,<br/>
That underneath had veins of liquid fire<br/>
Sluc’d from the Lake, a second multitude<br/>
With wondrous Art founded the massie Ore,<br/>
Severing each kinde, and scum’d the Bullion dross:<br/>
A third as soon had form’d within the ground<br/>
A various mould, and from the boyling cells<br/>
By strange conveyance fill’d each hollow nook,<br/>
As in an Organ from one blast of wind<br/>
To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths.<br/>
Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge<br/>
Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound<br/>
Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet,<br/>
Built like a Temple, where <i>Pilasters</i> round<br/>
Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid<br/>
With Golden Architrave; nor did there want<br/>
Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav’n,<br/>
The Roof was fretted Gold.  Not <i>Babilon</i>,<br/>
Nor great <i>Alcairo</i> such magnificence<br/>
Equal’d in all thir glories, to inshrine<br/>
<i>Belus</i> or <i>Serapis</i> thir Gods, or seat<br/>
Thir Kings, when <i>Aegypt</i> with <i>Assyria</i> strove<br/>
In wealth and luxurie.  Th’ ascending pile<br/>
Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores<br/>
Op’ning thir brazen foulds discover wide<br/>
Within, her ample spaces, o’re the smooth<br/>
And level pavement: from the arched roof<br/>
Pendant by suttle Magic many a row<br/>
Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed<br/>
With Naphtha and <i>Asphaltus</i> yeilded light<br/>
As from a sky.  The hasty multitude<br/>
Admiring enter’d, and the work some praise<br/>
And some the Architect: his hand was known<br/>
In Heav’n by many a Towred structure high,<br/>
Where Scepter’d Angels held thir residence,<br/>
And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King<br/>
Exalted to such power, and gave to rule,<br/>
Each in his Herarchie, the Orders bright.<br/>
Nor was his name unheard or unador’d<br/>
In ancient Greece; and in <i>Ausonian</i> land<br/>
Men call’d him <i>Mulciber</i>; and how he fell<br/>
From Heav’n, they fabl’d, thrown by angry <i>Jove</i><br/>
Sheer o’re the Chrystal Battlements: from Morn<br/>
To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve,<br/>
A Summers day; and with the setting Sun<br/>
Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star,<br/>
On <i>Lemnos</i> th’ <i>Aegaean</i> Ile: thus they relate,<br/>
Erring; for he with this rebellious rout<br/>
Fell long before; nor aught avail’d him now<br/>
To have built in Heav’n high Towrs; nor did he scape<br/>
By all his Engins, but was headlong sent<br/>
With his industrious crew to build in hell.<br/>
Mean while the winged Haralds by command<br/>
Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony<br/>
And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim<br/>
A solemn Councel forthwith to be held<br/>
At <i>Pandaemonium</i>, the high Capital<br/>
Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call’d<br/>
From every and Band squared Regiment<br/>
By place or choice the worthiest; they anon<br/>
With hundreds and with thousands trooping came<br/>
Attended: all access was throng’d, the Gates<br/>
And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall<br/>
(Though like a cover’d field, where Champions bold<br/>
Wont ride in arm’d, and at the Soldans chair<br/>
Defi’d the best of Panim chivalry<br/>
To mortal combat or carreer with Lance)<br/>
Thick swarm’d, both on the ground and in the air,<br/>
Brusht with the hiss of russling wings.  As Bees<br/>
In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides,<br/>
Poure forth thir populous youth about the Hive<br/>
In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers<br/>
Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank,<br/>
The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel,<br/>
New rub’d with Baume, expatiate and confer<br/>
Thir State affairs.  So thick the aerie crowd<br/>
Swarm’d and were straitn’d; till the Signal giv’n,<br/>
Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd<br/>
In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons<br/>
Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room<br/>
Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race<br/>
Beyond the <i>Indian</i> Mount, or Faerie Elves,<br/>
Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side<br/>
Or Fountain fome belated Peasant sees,<br/>
Or dreams he sees, while over head the Moon<br/>
Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth<br/>
Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth &amp; dance<br/>
Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear;<br/>
At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.<br/>
Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms<br/>
Reduc’d thir shapes immense, and were at large,<br/>
Though without number still amidst the Hall<br/>
Of that infernal Court.  But far within<br/>
And in thir own dimensions like themselves<br/>
The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim<br/>
In close recess and secret conclave sat<br/>
A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat’s,<br/>
Frequent and full.  After short silence then<br/>
And summons read, the great consult began.<br/>
